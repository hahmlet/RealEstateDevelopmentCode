No land or ownerships may be divided prior to approval of a partition or subdivision in accordance with \nthis code.  Except as provided for in 6.0001(B), if a development permit application to divide land is \nsubmitted that does not involve other proposed development, the application shall state an intended form \nof future development for the resulting land parcels.  This intended future development will then be \nprocessed along with the land division processing just as though the applicant were intending to proceed \nwith the further development. \nB. For non-residential land divisions where it is more practical to determine how public facilities will be \nprovided in a required subsequent development permit application, the proposed land division may be \napproved if: \n1. It is feasible to provide public facilities to each lot; and  \n2. Adequate public facilities are provided with further development.  \nC. A land division is processed by approving a tentative plan prior to approval of the final plat.  If there is \ncompliance with the approved tentative plan, the Manager may approve final plats for land divisions under \nthe Type I procedure. \nD. An application for an expedited land division will be processed in accordance with the provisions of ORS \n197.360 through 197.380. \n \n",
