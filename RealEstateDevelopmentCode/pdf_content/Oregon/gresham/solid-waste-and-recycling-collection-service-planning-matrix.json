These are guidelines based on actual \nservice levels at existing developments. They should be used in conjunction with the relevant sections of the \nGresham Development Code and the Gresham Revised Code referenced below to improve collection \nefficiencies. \n \nDevelopment Code provisions pertaining to solid waste collection areas \nSee Section 7.0212 -- Standards for Solid Waste Recycling and Service and Collection Areas for new Multi-Family, \nCommercial and Industrial Development. Each development proposal is unique and the collection efficiency is \naffected by community design including street and building layout, access and signage. \nSee attachment 1.1 \n \nGresham Revised Code provisions pertaining to solid waste collection areas \nSee Chapter 7.25.415 -- Location of Receptacles and Standards for Collection Area (Customer) \nSee attachment 1.2  \n \nEnclosure Roof Height \nCity code regulates how stormwater run-off must be handled at new commercial, industrial, and multifamily \ndevelopments. Development applicants should consult the City\u2019s Development Engineering staff for complete \ninformation on these requirements. It is important to note that if a developer intends to build a roof over a \ngarbage and recycling collection enclosure as a means of meeting these requirements, the height of the roof and \nconfiguration of the enclosure must be compatible with the solid waste hauler\u2019s collection equipment. The \ndevelopment applicant and the hauler should collaborate as early as possible during the project design phase to \naddress roof height and enclosure configuration issues. Roof height requirements are listed in the City\u2019s \nStormwater Manual. \n \nCost Efficiency and Environmental Sustainability \nThe least expensive solid waste collection service for the owner or tenant of a commercial, industrial, or \nmultifamily property is one that minimizes the number of service stops per week. Service of a larger container \ncollected less frequently provides a business or apartment owner with the opportunity to save a considerable \namount of money over time compared to service with a smaller container serviced more frequently. Enclosures, \nand the truck access to them, should be designed to allow for this more cost-effective service. Refer to the \nDevelopment Code and Gresham Revised Code provisions noted above for more information on the design \nparameters. \n \nThe City of Gresham is committed to helping build a more sustainable community, one that minimizes its use of \nnatural resources, protects the environment, and creates a healthy and positive setting for its residents. \nReducing the frequency of solid waste collection service, as described above, contributes to that by reducing \ntruck trips and their corresponding traffic and emissions impacts. \n \nContact Information \nCity of Gresham Development Planning  \n503-618-2842 \nCity of Gresham Development Engineering \n503-618-2424 \nCity of Gresham Recycling & Solid Waste \n503-618-2624 \nSolid Waste Hauling Companies  \n \nVisit: https://greshamoregon.gov/Recycling-and-Solid-Waste/  \n \n",

Therefore, the total truck trips in front of a given home equal roughly 130 each year. This high frequency \nof service means that any service related inefficiencies, barriers, safety hazards or conflicts are magnified \nsignificantly. \n \nAccess \nEfficient, automated service is crucial to mitigate safety, noise and quality of life impacts from inefficient service \nand workarounds. Access to containers is critical to efficiency. Impediment can include: \n\u2022 \nParked cars that impede the automated truck from reaching containers \n\u2022 \nImproperly placed containers \n\u2022 \nNarrow or dead-end streets \n\u2022 \nLow-hanging building features and vegetation \n \nTruck Size and Turning Radius \nThe largest and most common residential garbage truck has a length of 37\u2019, which should dictate the design of \nstreets, turnaround areas, etc. Streets should be designed to accommodate trucks with a turn radius of 50\u2019, \nclearance of 18\u2019, and weight of 52,000 lbs. Truck dimensions are 37\u2019 (L) X 8.5\u2019 (W) X 14\u2019 (H). The clearance of 18\u2019 \nlisted above accounts for the tipping of a waste container in the truck.  \n \nA standard emergency services hammerhead turnaround, consistent with the City\u2019s standard for road \nimprovements, may be granted in lieu of the cul-de-cac when the design is approved by the fire marshal. \n \nService Cart Size and Placement Area \nResidential customers are serviced with plastic roll carts. For the automated truck to service the carts, there \nshould be a 3\u2019 space between each cart placed at the curb, to allow for the hydraulic calipers to grasp each \ncontainer. Therefore, the area needed for each home should use the following formula: \n \n35 gallon cart (20\u201dw) + 36\u201d gap + 90 gallon recycling \ncart (28\u201d) + glass tub (22\u201d) is the maximum width \nneeded per household.  The needed area is therefore \n106\u201d (or 8\u201910\u201d) per household. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Access to the containers typically happens at the \nenclosure, but containers can be moved by the property owner to a reasonably accessible location if needed.  In \nthose situations, a plan that ensures this movement must be provided. \n \nIf enclosures are located inside a property, in a location that is not accessible to the collection truck, the \nproponent must ensure that the property owner or manager will move the containers to an accessible location \nfor automated service, each service day. \n \nCommercial and Multi-family Truck Size and Turning Radius \nThe largest and most common commercial garbage truck has a length of 37\u2019 which should inform the design, \naccess and turnaround areas, driveways, etc.  Driveways/lots should be designed to accommodate trucks with a \nturn radius of 50\u2019, clearance of 22\u2019, and weight of 64,000 lbs.  Truck dimensions are 36\u2019(L) X 10\u2019(W) X 14\u2019(H).  \n(The clearance of 22\u2019 listed above accounts for the tipping of a waste containers into the truck).  \n \n \nCommon Issues  \nDesigning enclosures that do not allow direct truck access cause inefficiencies and worker safety issues. Turning radiuses \nthat do not accommodate large trucks reduce access and can cause damage to curbs, in-ground service boxes, etc.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

If the enclosure is too small, people tend to leave bins outside, which is not \nallowed. If the containers are jammed inside a small enclosure, it is very difficult for collection \nstaff to remove them for trash and recycling collection. \nA larger enclosure provides room to allow flexibility in changes in service.  Food generating businesses will need \nroom for food scrap collection containers and oil collection. \n \nPoor siting. An enclosure at the end of an alley or in a place without adequate maneuvering \nroom for service vehicles creates a dangerous situation for collection staff, as well as for \nvehicles and pedestrians. Typically, there is no other person aboard a garbage truck to guide the \ndriver out of a narrow driveway or around a blind corner. \n \nInadequate gates. The gates need to be large enough to pull a container straight out. For most \ncommercial structures, this means a 20-foot wide opening. Gates that do not lock in the open \nposition can swing shut. \n \nInadequate pad. A Portland cement concrete pad minimizes damage caused by the containers. \nIt should be level and well-drained. The percent of grade for access to the pad shall not exceed 3%. \n \nFailure to post no parking signs. Garbage and recycling trucks typically arrive early in the \nmorning, but this is not always the case. If other vehicles are parked in the way it may be impossible to collect \nthe trash or recycling. \n \nNo bumpers. Bumpers on the ground or mounted on walls in the interior of the enclosure protect it from the \nimpacts of the heavy containers. \n \n \n \nEnclosure Designs \n \nPlans submitted to the City should detail the location and size of the enclosure to demonstrate meeting the \nstandards for Solid Waste Recycling \nand Service and Collection Areas.  The \nplan should also show container \nfootprints to demonstrate the \nenclosure is large enough for collection \nequipment.  See Receptacle Sizes on \npage 6.  \n \nApplicants can contact the Solid Waste \nmanager for assistance to determine \nthe best service level and size of \ncontainers needed. \n \n \n \n \n \n",
