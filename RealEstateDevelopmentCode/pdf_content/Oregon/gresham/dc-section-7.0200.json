Purpose and Applicability and Design Criteria and Standards \n1. Transit and Pedestrian Design Criteria and Standards are intended to provide for convenient, direct, \nand accessible pedestrian routes to and from public sidewalks and transit facilities and other \npedestrian destinations; to provide for safe, pleasant, and convenient pedestrian circulation by \nconnecting activities within a structure to the adjacent sidewalk and to nearby transit stops; and to \npromote the use of pedestrian and transit modes to retail and commercial facilities.   Standards for \nwindows and walls are designed to encourage surveillance opportunities, to avoid a monotonous \npedestrian environment, and to prevent fortress-like facades along public streets. \n2. Transit and Pedestrian Design Criteria and Standards shall apply to development along designated \nDesign Streets as shown on Figure 7.0210 and in those Station Center lands that are not within the \nRockwood Design District.  Section 7.0210(B)(8) and Section 7.0210(B)(10)(b) do apply to \ndevelopments within the Rockwood Design District. \n3. Exceptions to Transit and Pedestrian Design Criteria and Standards on Design Streets \na. Certain motor vehicle service uses permitted in the underlying district are exempt from Transit \nand Pedestrian Design Criteria and Standards:  These uses include gas pump islands, service \nstations, car washes, and vehicle service bays.  However, walk-in retail uses such as a mini-mart \nor convenience store connected with a motor vehicle service use, are not exempt. \nb. Industrial uses within the General and Heavy Industrial Districts. \nc. When a site has frontage on both a Design Street and on other streets, the Transit and \nPedestrian Design Criteria and Standards shall apply only to site development along the Design \nStreet frontage, unless otherwise specified. \n4. Orientation/Design of Building and Entrance for Non-Residential Buildings on Design Streets and in \nthose Station Center lands that are not within the Rockwood Design District. \na. Primary building and entry orientation shall be to the street rather than to a parking lot.  All \nbuildings shall have at least one (1) of their primary entrances oriented toward a Design Street, \nor (if no Design Street in the Station Center lands that are not within the Rockwood Design \n",

Primary entrances for \nnon-residential development shall be open to the public during all business hours. \nd. Primary building entrances shall be architecturally emphasized and visible from the street. \ne. All building entrances and exits shall be well lighted.  All unit entrances shall be posted with the \nassigned address as determined by the Manager.  Failure to post an address as assigned by the \nManager shall constitute a violation of the Code.  Exterior lighting should be an integral part of \nthe architectural and landscape design.  The minimum lighting level for non-residential building \nentries is an average of 3.5 foot-candles.  Lighting shall be a pedestrian scale (3 feet to 12 feet) \nand the source light shall be shielded to reduce glare.  \nf. For building facades over 300 feet in length on a Design Street, two or more primary entrances \nfacing the street must be provided.  \ng. Building entrances shall incorporate arcades, roofs, porches, alcoves, porticoes, and awnings \nthat protect pedestrians from the rain and sun. \nh. Building entries must comply with the accessibility standards as outlined in the Building Code. \n5. Ground Floor Windows, Window Walls, Blank Walls, and Design for Non-Residential Buildings on \nDesign Streets and in those Station Center lands that are not within the Rockwood Design District. \na. All development shall provide ground floor windows along street facades.  Required window \nareas must be either windows that allow views into working areas or lobbies, or pedestrian \nentrances, or display windows.  Required windows shall have a sill no higher than 4 feet above \ngrade, except as follows:  Where interior floor levels prohibit such placement, the sill height may \nbe raised to allow it to be no more than 2 feet above the finished floor level, up to a maximum \nsill height of  6 feet above grade. \nb. For any wall within 30 feet of a street, at least 20% of the ground floor wall area facing the \nstreet shall be display areas, windows, or doorways.  Blank walls are prohibited. \nc. Darkly tinted windows and mirrored windows that block two way visibility are prohibited as \nground floor windows along street facades. \nd. Buildings must include changes in relief on 15% of their street facades such as cornices, bases, \nwindow treatments, fluted masonry, or other designs for pedestrian interest and scale. \ne. Building facades greater than 100 feet in length shall have offset jogs, using elements such as \nbay windows and recessed entrances for pedestrian scale. \n6. Except for uses exempted under Section 7.0210(A)(3), Section 9.0821 (Parking Lot Location on \nDesign Streets) shall apply to parking lots on sites that are subject to the Transit and Pedestrian \nDesign Criteria and Standards.   \n7.
