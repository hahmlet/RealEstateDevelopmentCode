General Guidelines for Architectural Design Review: \n1. \nBuildings should promote and enhance a comfortable pedestrian scale and orientation. Facades \nshould be varied and articulated to provide visual interest to pedestrians. Within larger projects, \nvariations in facades, floor levels, architectural features, and exterior finishes are encouraged to \ncreate the appearance of several smaller buildings. \n2. \nUpper stories should be articulated with features such as bays and balconies. \n3. \nTo balance horizontal features on longer facades, vertical building elements, such as stairs to \nupper stories and building entries, should be emphasized. \n4. \nBuildings should incorporate features such as arcades, roofs, porches, alcoves, porticoes, and \nawnings to protect pedestrians from the rain and sun. \n5. \nSpecial attention should be given to designing a primary building entrance, which is both \nattractive and functional. Primary entrances should be clearly visible from the street, and \nincorporate changes in mass, surface, or finish to give emphasis to the entrance. All building \nentrances and exits should be well lit. \n6. \nBuildings located at the intersection of two streets should consider the use of a corner entrance \nto the building. \n7. \nExterior building materials and finishes should convey an impression of permanence and \ndurability, and reflect a northwest architectural style by using locally produced building \nmaterials.  Materials such as masonry, stone, wood, terra cotta, and tile are encouraged. \nWindows are also encouraged, where they allow views to interior activity areas or displays. \n8. \nWhere masonry is used for exterior finish, decorative patterns (other than running bond pattern) \nshould be considered. These decorative patterns may include multi-colored masonry units, such \nas brick, tile, stone, or cast stone, in a layered or geometric pattern, or multi-colored ceramic tile \nbands used in conjunction with materials such as concrete or stucco. \n9. \nAll roof and wall-mounted mechanical, electrical, communications, and service equipment, \nincluding satellite dishes and vent pipes, shall be removed or screened from public view by \nparapets, walls, fences, dense evergreen foliage, or by other suitable means. \n",

The regulations of this chapter implement the management of stormwater runoff \nfrom all new development in ways that minimize impacts on localized and downstream flooding and \nprotect water quality and aquatic habitat through the use of green development practices. The guiding \nprincipal of green development practices is to mimic the natural hydrology of watersheds to manage \nstormwater drainage and water quality, moderate air and water temperatures, and provide aesthetic \nvalue. \nB. \nStormwater runoff from new development shall be managed on-site. Applicants for new development \nmust submit a stormwater report that must be approved by the manager prior to issuance of a \nbuilding permit. The stormwater management plan, as required by the Gresham Stormwater \nManagement Manual, shall provide details for developing in a manner that eliminates adverse impacts \nto water quality and aquatic habitat in downstream water bodies, with a particular focus on water \nquality parameters that are listed under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act and species that are \nlisted as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Specific requirements for the \nstormwater report are detailed in the Stormwater Management Manual. \nC. \nParking lot landscaping may be used as the water quality treatment facility for parking lots. \n1. \nPurpose: This section is enacted with the purpose of achieving multiple functions from parking \nlot landscaping by using it for on-site/on-lot stormwater facilities for water quality treatment. \n2. \nAppropriate designs are contained in the Gresham Stormwater Management Manual. \n3. \nLandscaping for stormwater management within parking lots will count towards total \npercentage of landscaping required on site. \nD. \nStormwater discharges from private property must be discharged into an approved conveyance \nfacility. Direct discharge to the Johnson Creek and its tributaries must be limited to the maximum \nextent possible and must have prior approval from the City. \nE. \nA grading or building permit may not be issued for a property unless a stormwater management plan \nhas been approved that is consistent with this section. \nF. \nOperations and maintenance requirements \n1. \nThe property owner, its successors or assigns, including any property manager, shall adequately \nmaintain the on-site/on-lot stormwater management facilities according to the operations and \nmaintenance specifications for those facilities outlined in the most recent version of Gresham\u2019s \nStormwater Management Manual. \n2. \nA homeowners association may take over maintenance of on-site stormwater facilities provided \nthat the homeowners association enters into a contract with the City agreeing to take over \noperations and maintenance from the property owner(s) and provided that provisions for \nfinancing necessary maintenance are included in deed restrictions or other contractual \nagreements.

Prior to approval of any building permit, existing trees, shrubs, and/or \nResource Areas that are to be preserved shall be defined in the field. These plants and areas \nshall be defined by a minimum of a four (4) foot high visibility fence (polyethylene, painted, \nwooden slat, snow fence, etc.) which is to be located no closer than the drip line of the \nvegetation to be preserved and which is to remain and be maintained throughout the \nconstruction period until ready for revegetation. \n4. \nRevegetation of Disturbed Land. Development activities should only disturb, clear, or grade the \narea necessary for construction. All areas disturbed by grading or construction, not being \nformally landscaped, shall be mulched and revegetated with seeding and/or other plant \nmaterials. All seeded areas shall receive seeding mulch (straw-crimped in place or hydromulch, \netc.).  \n5. \nKeep vehicles and construction equipment out of undisturbed areas to preserve the natural \nground cover and vegetation. \n6. \nNoxious Weeds. It is the duty of any property owner or occupant to control noxious weeds \nwhich aggressively invade native plant communities or are carriers of detrimental insects, \ndiseases, or parasites. \n7. \nIrrigation System Requirements. Landscape improvements shall be properly irrigated during that \nperiod of time necessary for the plant to be established on the site and on an ongoing basis so as \nto maintain the landscape in good health and condition. The applicant must indicate what \nmethod of irrigation is proposed for any required landscape improvements. Some species may \nnot require formal irrigation after their establishment period. It is encouraged that temporary, \nabove ground piping and heads or hand watering be used for these plants during their \nestablishment period to promote water conservation once the plant has become established. \n",
