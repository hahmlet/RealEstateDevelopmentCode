A detached accessory structure may be constructed or installed when in \nconformance with the standards of this section.  Rigid frame fabric membrane structures are accessory \nstructures. \nAccessory Dwelling units are not subject to the standards of Section 10.0200 and are regulated by the standards \nin Section 10.0100. \n10.0202  Accessory Structure Setbacks \nTable 10.0202 demonstrates the setbacks for accessory structures in different conditions.  If not specified below, \naccessory structures shall be subject to standards as identified in the respective land use district where the \nstructure is to be located, and, within Section 7.0400, as applicable. \nTable 10.0202  Accessory Structure Setbacks \nAccessory \nStructure Size \nCondition \nSetback from side \nlot line \nSetback from \nrear lot line \nSetback from \nother structures \nLess than 200 sq.ft. \nHeight up to 10 ft. from \nfinished floor to average roof \nsurface \n3 feet \n3 feet \nSetbacks between \nstructures shall \nmeet Building Code \nstandards. \nHeight more than 10 ft. from \nfinished floor to average roof \nsurface \n5 feet \n5 feet \nSetbacks between \nstructures shall \nmeet Building Code \nstandards. \nBetween 200 and 500 \nsq. ft. \n \n5 feet \n5 feet \nSetbacks between \nstructures shall \nmeet Building Code \nstandards. \nBetween 500 and \n1,000 sq. ft. \n \nShall conform to underlying district \nstandard \nSetbacks between \nstructures shall \nmeet Building Code \nstandards. \n",

See Section 7.0440 (J) for Cottage Clusters \naccessory structure size limitations. \nB. \nThe roof of the structure shall be constructed so that water runoff from the structure does not flow onto \nan abutting parcel. \nC. \nNo accessory structure shall be placed closer to the street than the farthest back front wall of the \ndwelling unit closest to that street. \nD. \nFor accessory structures located within 5 feet of a side or rear property line, the structure shall be \nmoveable.  For example, it may be built on skids or on a concrete slab with embedded pull loops. \nE. \nMore than one accessory structure may be placed or built on a site, provided: \n1. \nThe maximum floor area ratio of the underlying land use district is maintained; and \n2. \nWith the exception of Accessory Dwelling units as regulated by Section 10.0100, for lots smaller \nthan one acre, the cumulative total of all accessory structures square footage does not exceed \n1,000 square feet.  \nF. \nAn accessory structure may be located on an adjacent lot that does not contain a primary structure \nprovided: \n1. \nBoth lots are under the exact same ownership; and \n2. \nA deed restriction is recorded requiring the accessory structure to be removed within 30 days of \ntransfer of ownership of either lot into separate ownership. \n3. \nThe accessory structure complies with setback requirements as applied to the lots under same \nownership.  \nG. \nIn the LDR-5, LDR-7, TR or TLDR District an attached or detached covered patio or covered deck may \nbe placed between 3 feet to 5 feet from any interior side or rear yard setback provided that: \n1. \nThe height of the patio or deck cover in the setback area is not greater than 12 feet above grade. \n2. \nThe roof of the structure is constructed so that water runoff from the structure does not flow onto \nan abutting parcel. \n3. \nIt does not encroach into the 6-foot maintenance easement area associated with zero lot line \nconditions. \nH. \nNon-Conforming Accessory Structures: \n1. \nA new accessory structure must meet the requirements of Section 10.0200; it may not be placed \nin the same location of a non-conforming accessory structure that was removed.   \n2. \nNo additions are permitted to non-conforming accessory structures, even if the addition does not \nincrease the non-conforming situation.   \n",
