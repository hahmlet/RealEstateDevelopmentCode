The Historic Resources Subcommittee may recommend to the Council the \ndesignation of resources as historic or cultural landmarks. Resources designated as landmarks shall be \nincluded in the Historic and Cultural Landmarks List, adopted as an appendix to the Gresham \nCommunity Development Code, and shall be indicated on the Community Development Plan Map with \nan HL overlay district designation. A resource may be designated a historic or cultural landmark upon \nfinding that at least one of the following criteria is satisfied: \n1. \nThe resource possesses significance in the history of Gresham, Multnomah County, the State of \nOregon, or the nation as evidenced by: \na. Association with the lives of persons holding a significant place in the history of the \ncommunity; or \nb. Association with significant past events, trends, or values that may be either cultural, \neconomic, social, or political. \n2. \nThe resource possesses architectural significance as evidenced by: \na. Embodiment of the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; or \nb. Development of the resource early in the sequence of local history; or \nc. Rarity of the resource type in the area; or \nd. Retention of the integrity of the original design of the resource. \n3. \nThe resource is representative of the work of a designer, architect, or master builder who \ninfluenced the development and appearance of Gresham, the State of Oregon, or the nation. \n4. \nA resource has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. \nB. \nProcedure for Designation. Designation of a site, structure, or object as a historic or cultural landmark \nmay be proposed by the owner, by the Historic Resources Subcommittee, by the Planning Commission, \nor by the Council. A proposal for landmark designation shall first be considered by the Subcommittee. \nThe Subcommittee shall recommend approval, approval with modifications, or denial of the proposed \nlandmarks designation, and shall make its recommendation based on findings made in response to the \ncriteria of Section 5.0322(A). The recommendation and all findings shall be transmitted to the City \nCouncil and the proposal shall be processed under the Type IV procedure. \n1. \nIn acting to approve or approve with modifications a proposed landmarks designation, findings \nshall be made as to the location and quality of the resource and any conflicting uses that might \naffect the resource. Based on such consideration, the Council shall act to include the resource on \nthe Historic and Cultural Landmarks List as a Class 1 or a Class 2 landmark. \n2. \nWhen designation of a Class 1 or Class 2 landmark occurs by action of the Council, the parcel on \nwhich the landmark is located shall be indicated on the Community Development Plan Map as \nbeing in the HL district. However, for purposes of applying provisions of Section 5.0321, 5.0322, \nand 5.0323 of the Community Development Code, only the specific site, structure or object \ndesignated on the List shall be considered to be the landmark, and other structures, uses and \nimprovements on the parcel shall not be subject to those provisions.  \n3.  \nThe City shall notify property owners at three-year intervals by first class mail of the existence of \n",

The notice shall include a copy of the Section \n5.0300 landmark regulations. \n4. \nIf during the procedure for adding a property to the Historic and Cultural Landmarks List, the \nproperty owner submits oral or written testimony in the record objecting to its addition, it shall not \nbe added to the List. \na. No permit for the demolition or modification of a property removed from consideration for \ndesignation under this section shall be issued during the 120-day period following the date of \nthe property owner\u2019s refusal to consent. \n5. \nProperties that have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places: \na.

Can demonstrate that the owner objected to the designation on the public record, or \nb. Was not provided an opportunity to object to the designation. \n2. \nExcept as provided in Section 5.0323(A)(1) above, the City may only remove a resource from \nthe Historic and Cultural Landmarks List if: \n \na. The resource has lost the qualities for which it was originally recognized; or \nb. Additional information shows that the resource no longer satisfies the criteria for \nrecognition as a historic resource or did not satisfy the criteria for recognition as a historic \nresource at the time of listing; or \nc. The local building official declares that the resource poses a clear and immediate hazard to \npublic safety and must be demolished to abate the unsafe condition. \nB. \nProcedure for Change in Status or Removal of Historic or Cultural Landmark Designation \n1. \nIf the property owner has retained ownership since the time of designation and wishes to \nremove a landmark designation per 5.0323(A)(1), the application will be processed under the \nType I procedure, findings under Section 5.0322(A) are not required. \n2. \nRemoval, entirely or in part, of landmark designation from a landmark resource per \n5.0323(A)(2)(a) or (b) or, with consent of the owner, a change in the status of a landmark as a \nClass 1 or Class 2 landmark may be proposed by the owner of the landmark, by the Historic \nResources Subcommittee, by the Planning Commission, or by the Council. The proposal will be \nprovided to the Historic Resources Subcommittee which may recommend to the Manager \napproval, approval with modifications, or denial of the proposed removal of landmark \ndesignation or change in status, and shall make its recommendation based on findings made in \nresponse to the criteria of Section 5.0322(A).
