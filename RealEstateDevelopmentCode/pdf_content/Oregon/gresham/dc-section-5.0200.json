Programmatic Permits may only be obtained by Public Agencies and Utilities \nwith a Gresham franchise license to allow for routine public facility or utility operation, repair and \nreplacement, and/or on-going maintenance or enhancement programs. The purpose of a Programmatic \nPermit is to eliminate the need for individual tree removal permits for ongoing activities within the \nHGRO.  Programmatic permits do not cover tree protection, removal, planting, or mitigation associated \nwith a development permit. \n1. Time Limits. The Manager may approve a Programmatic Permit for a period of up to 2 years. An \nannual report from the Applicant on activity conducted under the permit is required to be submitted \nto the Manager by June 30 each year.  Failure to submit the annual report will result in \ncancellation/suspension of the Programmatic Permit. \n2. Work Standards.  All work conducted under a programmatic permit must be conducted in \naccordance with proper arboricultural practices as detailed in the most recent version of ANSI A300 \nstandards. \n3. Review Factors.  The Manager may approve a Programmatic Permit for work in the HGRO and \nHSS upon finding that the following review factors are met or will be met with conditions, \naccording to the Gresham Environmental Technical Guidance Manual: \na.

Erosion Control: Activities will be planned to prevent exposed soil areas of greater than 500 \nsquare feet during the wet weather window of October 1 to May 1. \nc. Mitigation of Impacts:  The activities will protect or improve project area conditions as they \nrelate to water quality, critical habitat protection, and forest health. \nd. Risk reduction: \ni. \nIgnition fuel reduction at the private-public property interface shall occur before any \nadditional coarse woody debris (CWD) is placed as part of stand management activities. \nii. CWD shall be placed in a manner not likely to increase wildfire, slope movement, or public \nsafety risks. \niii. Deciduous vegetation will be preferred for retention in defined firebreak areas. \niv. Coniferous vegetation will not be planted in defined firebreak areas. \nv. Suspended branch material is addressed as part of site activities. \nvi. Allowance for amount and location limitations for cut or chipped CWD are observed. \nvii.

Gaps \u2013 Resultant gaps of less than 55,000 square feet after combining the above lands. \n6. Excluded areas \u2013 The following lands were excluded: \na. Lands regulated by DOGAMI for surface mining. \nb. Lands north of Glisan Street \nB. \nHighly Sloped Subarea (HSS) includes all lands within the Hillside and Geologic Risk Overlay with \nthe following attributes: \n1. Lands with concentrations of slopes of 35% or greater. Concentrations are identified using raster \nanalysis of the LiDAR-derived Bare-Earth DEM created as part of the Oregon LiDAR Consortium \nMetro 2014 Project.  The DEM is processed into percent slope rise and then slope is averaged for \neach cell across the surrounding cells within a 45-foot radius circle. Cells with an average \nsurrounding slope of 35% or greater are included. Prior to analysis, the DEM is edited to remove the \nfollowing lands: \na. Lands that represent temporary slope features that are no longer present. \nb. Areas with underlying DEM data quality issues. \n2. Lands within 5 feet of areas identified in accordance with Subsection (1). \n \n5.0215  HGRO Map Administration and Correction \nA. \nMap Administration. The City shall incorporate all map updates associated with development permit \napplications and corrections to the location of the HSS and HGRO as necessary.  This shall be processed \nunder a Type I procedure and is not considered a comprehensive plan map amendment.  \nB. \nMap Corrections. All Applicants who believe that the HGRO and/or HSS was mapped based upon \nincorrect data may file a verification request consistent with this Subsection, and as described in the \nGresham Environmental Technical Guidance Manual. Verification requests will be processed under the \nType I development permit procedure. \n1. HGRO Boundary. Applicants may request a site-specific correction of the HGRO boundary and the \nCity shall incorporate such corrections to the HGRO using the protocols in 5.0214 with \nmodifications to the input data allowed under the following scenarios: \na. DEM Data Issues: Data issues with the Oregon LiDAR Consortium Metro 2014 Project Bare-\nEarth DEM used in the creation of DOGAMI IMS-57 Shallow Landslide Susceptibility Hazard \nraster may be addressed where provided for here. Such issues must be delineated to within 3 \nfeet of the data issue(s) and submitted as an ESRI Shapefile (polygon) accompanied by two \n",

The two maps must delineate the data issues at a scale of no less than 1 inch to \n100 feet. One map must show the data issue(s), current HGRO boundary, and the Oregon \nLiDAR Consortium Metro 2014 Project Bare-Earth DEM. A second map must show the data \nissue(s), current HGRO boundary, and the DOGAMI IMS-57 Shallow Landslide Susceptibility \nHigh hazard data.  The following DEM Data Issues may be addressed: \ni. Temporary Slope Features. Lands with prioritized hazard areas that represent temporary \nslope features that are no longer present, such as stockpiles that have been removed, may be \nextracted from the Shallow Landslide Hazard dataset. \nii. DEM Data Quality Issues: Areas of hazard inaccurately identified due to underlying \nLiDAR-derived Bare-Earth Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data quality issues related to \nstructures may be extracted from the Shallow Landslide Hazard Dataset. Acceptable data \nquality issues are those defined in the \u201cOregon LiDAR Consortium Metro 2014 Lidar \nProject Quality Control Report \u2013 November 30, 2016\u201d and which are related to structures. \nThe data issue narrative must identify the specific data quality issue(s) for each polygon \nsubmitted. \nb. Mapped Stream Changes: Mapped stream changes incorporated through Section 5.0715(C) \n(NRO Map Corrections). \nc. Newly mapped landslide(s): Newly mapped landslide deposit(s) and scarp flank(s) which have \nbeen mapped by a Registered Geologist or Certified Engineering Geologist. \n2. HSS Boundary. Applicants may request a site-specific correction of the HSS boundary by providing \non-site slope survey data, new HSS boundary, and an HSS analysis map prepared in accordance \nwith the following: \na. On-site survey data: A survey shall be submitted of the natural/existing topography for the site \nof the proposed area of correction and a 50-foot buffer around it, stamped by a registered Civil \nEngineer or licensed Land Surveyor. If access in the 50-foot buffer cannot be acquired, data \nfrom the Oregon LiDAR Consortium Metro 2014 Project Bare-Earth DEM may be substituted. \nSurvey data must be provided as bare-earth DEM raster as well as a percent slope raster \ncalculated using the bare-earth DEM. Survey data must meet or exceed standards set in \u201cOregon \nLiDAR Consortium Metro 2014 Lidar Project Quality Control Report \u2013 November 30, 2016\u201d \nincluding an absolute vertical error of less than 0.20 meters. \nb. New HSS boundary data: The new slope raster must be processed according to the mapping \nprotocol in Section 5.0214(B) and provided as a raster dataset. \nc. HSS analysis map: A map shall be provided having a scale of not less than 1 inch to 100 feet \nand a contour interval of not more than 10 feet with two-foot intermediates. The map shall also \nindicate the datum, source, and scale of topographic data used in the slope analysis and shall \nattest to the fact that the slope analysis has been accurately calculated. The map shall clearly \ndelineate/identify the slopes of 35% or greater and new HSS boundary. The map shall be \nprepared using CAD-based, GIS-based, or other type of software specifically designed for such \npurpose. \nd. Raster data requirements: Raster datasets must be provided as outlined in the Gresham \nEnvironmental Technical Guidance Manual. \n \n",
