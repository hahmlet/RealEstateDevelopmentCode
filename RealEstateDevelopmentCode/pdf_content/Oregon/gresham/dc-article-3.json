The best standard technique for its determination uses \nspectrophotometric measurements, with an integrating sphere to determine the reflectance at each different \nwavelength. The average reflectance is then determined by an averaging process, using a standard solar \nspectrum. This method is documented by ASTM (Amer. Soc. for Testing and Materials) as Standards E903 \nand E892.   \nRegistered Child Care Facility.

See also Battery Exchange Station. \n\u2022 \nElectric Vehicle Charging Unit.  A parking space that is served by battery charging equipment \nwhose primary purpose is to charge batteries within electric vehicles via the transfer of electric energy \n(by conductive or inductive means) to a battery or other energy storage device in an electric vehicle. \n\u2022 \nPhotovoltaic Panel.  A device used for the production of electric power through the conversion of \nlight to electric power by semiconductor devices. \n\u2022 \nRenewable Energy Systems.  Systems which produce energy from sources that do not use up \nfinite natural resources. Examples include solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, and micro-hydro. \n\u2022 \nSolar Electric System.  Equipment and devices that convert and store or transfer energy from the \nsun to produce electricity that is distributed to the building via an electrical panel or to the grid, \noffsetting electric energy that would otherwise be purchased from the utility. It typically consists of \ntwo primary components: \n\u2022 Photovoltaic panels or cells, which are commonly installed on the roof or the building walls \nor windows; and \n\u2022 One or more inverters, which convert the direct current electricity produced by the panels \ninto alternating current electricity that can be used by the building or stored in batteries. \n\u2022 \nSolar Reflective Index.  A measure of the constructed surface\u2019s ability to reject or reflect solar heat \n(e.g. a roof) as shown by a small temperature rise. It is defined so that a standard black surface \n(reflectance 0.05, emittance 0.90) is 0 and a standard white surface (reflectance 0.80, emittance \n0.90) is 100. The standard reflective index combines reflectance and emittance into one number. \nOnce the maximum temperature rise of a given material has been computed, the index can be \ncomputed by interpolating between the values for white and black. Materials with the highest \nvalues are the coolest choices for roofing. \n\u2022 \nSolar Water Heating System.  Equipment and devices that have the primary purpose of collecting \nsolar energy by preheating water so that the water heater or boiler reduces energy consumption. The \nsystem typically consists of two primary components: \n\u2022 Solar collectors, which are commonly installed on the roof or the building walls or \nwindows; and \n\u2022 A storage tank, which is typically co-located with the water heater and in which potable \nwater is preheated by the solar collectors via a heat exchanger. \n",

Characteristics describe the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or \nresidents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and certain site factors. \nExample uses.  Examples uses include some examples of uses that are in the use category. The \nnames of uses on the lists are generic. They are based on the common meaning of the terms and not \non what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use whose business name is \u201cWholesale \nLiquidation\u201d but that sells mostly to consumers would be included in the Business and Retail \nService and Trade category rather than the Wholesale Trade category.  This is because the actual \nactivity on the site matches the description of the Business and Retail Service and Trade category. \nAccessory uses.  Accessory uses are allowed by right in conjunction within the use category unless \nstated otherwise.  They are subject to the same regulations as the primary use unless stated \notherwise. Common accessory uses are listed as examples with the categories. \nExceptions.

For example, a development that contains a retail bakery and a caf\u00e9 would be \nclassified in the Business and Retail Service and Trade category because all the primary uses are in that \ncategory. When the primary uses of a development fall within different use categories, each primary use is \nclassified in the applicable category and is subject to the regulations for that category. \n \n3.0206  Determination of Similar Use  \nThe purpose of the Determination of Similar Use procedure is to provide a process by which a proposed \nuse is classified.  This process is not needed when the comparison is obvious and the decision is non-\ndiscretionary. For example, it is clear than a yarn shop is similar to a gift store, an example of a Business \nand Service Retail and Trade. \nA determination may be relied upon for future determinations where circumstances are similar, but it does \nnot necessarily set precedent for subsequent determinations.  \nAn application for a Determination of Similar Use shall follow the Type II procedure per Section 11.0400, \nincluding the opportunity for an appeal.  It may be applied for separately or concurrent to another \ndevelopment application, such as a Design Review. A determination of similar use is not binding upon the \nHearings Officer, Design Commission, Planning Commission or City Council.  \nA. \nApplication.  The following shall be provided by the applicant: \n1. \nThe applicant may submit an assumed set of hypothetical facts that can be used to inform the \napplication. Any Determination of Similar Use decision that utilizes an assumed set of \nhypothetical facts will not determine the truth or falsity of such facts and such facts shall not \nbe subject to any substantial evidence in the record determination. Factual determinations \nwill not be made in a Determination of Similar Use. Such factual determinations are left to \nany later proceedings where a specific application is made for a development permit or \napplication.  \n2. \nThe applicant shall submit any additional materials as requested by the Manager for the \napplication. \nB. \nCriteria for a Determination of Similar Use. The criteria for a Determination of Similar Use are: \n1. \nThe Determination is consistent with the context of the Gresham Community Development \nPlan, Volume 2, including, particularly, the land use district in which the use is proposed. \n2. \nThe proposed use is of the same general type and is similar to other allowed uses in a sub-\ncategory. This may be determined by looking at the characteristics and example uses \nwithin the land use classifications found in Section 3.0200. \n3. \nThe Determination is consistent with the text of applicable Gresham Community \nDevelopment Code provisions. \n4. \nThe proposed use is consistent with the stated purpose of the land use district in which it is \nproposed, if available. \nC. \nIn instances where a development can meet the definition of more than one use (such as a single \ndetached dwelling unit with an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) or a duplex), the applicant shall \nspecify at the time of application review which classification the proposal is for.   \n \n",
