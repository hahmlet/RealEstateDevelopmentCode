Agricultural Products Sales, Commercial Stands or Other Temporary Uses  that wish to \nexceed the maximum permit duration may apply for an Interim Use permit. \n2 \nInterim Uses permits would renew automatically with the business license or, if no business license is required, at the one-year anniversary \nof when the initial Interim Use permit was issued, except when the use has been subject to a City Code Compliance enforcement action to \naddress an uncorrected violation as provided for in Gresham Revised Code Article 7.50. Enforcement actions include but are not limited to \ncivil penalties, citations and abatement. If an enforcement action has occurred, the use shall be reviewed at the time of renewal following the \nType II process in the same manner as an application for a new permit. In such a case, the enforcement action shall be considered during \nthe renewal application review, such as when determining conditions of approval. \n3 \nThe initial review for Interim Uses on a site shall be a Type II review. This would apply the first time any Agricultural Product Sales or \nCommercial Stands, Long Term application was filed for a site. In addition, a Type II process is required if additional uses occupy the site \nbeyond the number originally approved, such as a site adding a third Commercial Stand on a site approved for two stands.  \n4 \nFor these uses, a new Agricultural Product Sales use or Commercial Stand, Long Term can replace a previously approved like use under a \nType I process, as long as the permit obtained through a Type II review is active at the time of the Type I permit or was active within the last \n12 months prior to the Type I permit. For example, if a Commercial Stand leaves the site, it can be replaced by another Commercial Stand \nusing a Type I process if the Type II permit is current or was active within the last 12 months. Changing from a Commercial Stand to an \nAgricultural Product Sales use would require a Type II process. Applications from new owners shall comply with the latest Development \nCode standards.  \n10.1431 Standards for All Temporary, Intermittent and Interim Uses \nThe following standards apply to all uses in this section: \nA. Uses shall meet land-use district minimum setbacks for the site perimeter. \nB. Except for Temporary Dwellings, Intermittent Lodging and Warming/cooling Shelters, if a site where a \nTemporary, Intermittent or Interim Use is located abuts a lot with a residential use, the Temporary, \nIntermittent or Interim Use shall meet the minimum buffer width required in Section 9.0100 as shown \nin Table 9.0111(B). The Option 2 buffer width, when available, shall satisfy this standard. Buffer trees, \nshrubs and screening from that table are not required. Buffer widths shall be allowed to overlap with \n",
