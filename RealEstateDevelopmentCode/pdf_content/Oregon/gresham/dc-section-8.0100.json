      "text": " \n[8.01]-2 \nCity of Gresham Development Code \n \n(01/23) \n \nSpecial Use Review, Generally \n8.0101  Purpose  \nThe purpose of the Special Use Review section is to provide a method for evaluating uses that may be \ncompatible in an underlying land use district, provide beneficial services, and serve important public interests, \nbut require case-by-case review because of their size, operation, uniqueness, impact, or other characteristic. \nThese uses are subject to the regulations in this section because they may, but do not necessarily, result in \nsignificant impacts upon the surrounding area, neighborhood, environment, or public facilities. This section \nprovides the procedures under which uses subject to the Special Use Review process may be permitted, \nmodified, enlarged or intensified. \n \nSpecial use reviews are reviewed through a Type II or Type III procedure.  Those uses that have a broader \npublic interest or impact are reviewed through the Type III procedure.  Both review procedures provide an \nopportunity to allow the use when there are minimal impacts, to allow the use but impose mitigation measures to \naddress identified concerns, or to deny the use if concerns cannot be resolved. \n \nApproval of a Special Use Review shall not constitute a change in the land use district and shall be granted only \nfor the specific use approved at the specific site. Approval is subject to such modifications, conditions, and \nrestrictions as may be deemed appropriate by the review authority. \n8.0102  Applicability   \nUses that require a Special Use Review and are subject to the regulations of this section are stated in the use \ntables in Article 4 that apply to the site, or in the Land Use Classification System found in Section 3.0200. This \nincludes the permitting of a new use subject to this section and the modification, enlargement, or intensification \nof an existing use subject to this section. Section 8.0112 highlights uses subject to the Type II procedure. \nSection 8.0142 highlights uses subject to the Type III procedure.  \n \nOver time, Development Code regulations applicable to a specific site may change. This may be a result of \nchanges to the content of the regulations for a specific district or from a change to the Community Plan Map. \nAfter one of these changes, if an existing use was allowed outright, approved through the Community Service \nUse or Special Use Review, or was a nonconforming use and is now subject to the Special Use Review, the use \nis considered de facto approved and may continue to operate. Any modifications to the use are subject to the \nprocedures in this section, and shall be reviewed through the Type II procedure. \n \nWhen a proposed use is located on a site that is in more than one land use district, and the proposed use is \nsubject to a Special Use Review in one district and an allowed or limited use in the other, the proposal shall be \nsubject to Special Use Review. \n8.0103  General Standards  \nAn applicant for a Special Use Review shall provide a narrative that describes how the proposed use fulfills the \napplicable requirements and standards for the use and for those found in Article 7, Section 8.0100, the \napplicable plan district(s) for the site, and other applicable Code sections.  In order to minimize adverse impacts \nof the proposed use, an approval of a Special Use Review may be conditioned based upon information provided \nin the narrative and staff findings. \nFor purposes of the Special Use Review, the narrative shall describe the following, as applicable: \n1. The proposed use and its operations; \n",

The review provides \nan opportunity to allow a use when there are minimal impacts, to allow the use but impose mitigation measures \nto address identified concerns, or to deny the use if the concerns cannot be resolved.   \n \nThis review considers general standards found in Section 8.0103, standards specific to the use found in Sections \n8.0114-8.0122 and other Development Code standards which are applicable to the proposal.  The criteria and \nstandards set forth in this section apply only when the particular use is subject to a Special Use Review in the \nunderlying land use district.  The narrative for Special Use Reviews through the Type II procedure shall describe \nhow the operating and physical characteristics of the proposal have been made reasonably compatible with and \nhave a minimal impact on livability, appropriate use, and development of properties in the surrounding area of \nthe subject site. \n8.0112  Applicability of the Type II Procedure  \nThe following uses may pursue a Special Use Review through the Type II procedure when they are specified as \nbeing subject to a Special Use Review in Article 4 or in the Land Use Classification System found in Section \n3.0200. \nA.
