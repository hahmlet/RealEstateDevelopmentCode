The number of units \ncalculated on this basis shall be added to the number of units permitted on that portion of the parcel lying \noutside the OS district to determine the total number of dwelling units which may be developed on the non-OS \nportion of the parcel. Where a density transfer credit is allowed in a low density residential district, minimum lot \nsizes and lot dimensions as specified for detached dwellings and duplexes may be reduced on the non-OS \nportion of the parcel. In both low density and moderate density residential districts, all other applicable \ndevelopment standards, including setback and building heights, shall continue to apply when a density transfer occurs. \nResidential density transfer credits do not apply to affordable housing development under Section 10.1700. \nDevelopment Requirements \n5.0530  Site Development Requirements   \nSite development standards including minimum lot size and dimensions, minimum yard setbacks, and maximum \nbuilding height shall be as specified for the underlying Plan Map District designation, except as may be \nmodified through a Special Use Review, under Section 8.0100. \n5.0531  Design Standards and Supplementary Regulations   \nAll uses permitted in the OS district shall be designed in conformance with applicable provisions and \nrequirements of the Community Development Code. \n5.0532  Conservation of Open Space   \nThe design and development of any use permitted in the OS district shall take place in such a manner as to limit \nto the maximum extent possible the intrusion of buildings, off-street parking areas, and driveways into natural \nareas and areas of the site which are landscaped or in recreational use. \n \n \n",
