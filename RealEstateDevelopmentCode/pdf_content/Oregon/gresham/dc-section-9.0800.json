In order to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights, and parking lot lights from the public \nright-of-way and adjoining properties, all parking lots and maneuvering areas shall be landscaped. \nAdequately landscaped parking lots will reduce the area of impervious surfaces, can be used to treat and \ninfiltrate stormwater runoff from impervious areas of parking lots, reduce the level of carbon dioxide in \nareas of heavy vehicle use, return pure oxygen to the atmosphere, and provide shade as a means of \naltering the micro-climate of parking lots. \n",

The standards address the needs for both short-term and long-term \nbicycle parking. The required number of spaces is lower for uses that do not tend to attract bicycle riders \nand higher for those that do. Additionally, some bicycle parking is required on the basis of specifically \nencouraging employee, student or customer related bicycle use. \n \nLong-term bicycle parking spaces accommodate employees, students, residents, commuters, and other \npersons who expect to leave their bicycle parked for more than two hours. Long-term parking spaces \nprovide a secure and weather-protected location to park bicycles. As discussed further below, the intent \nof these standards is to provide long-term bicycle parking that is within a reasonable distance of the use. \nShort-term bicycle parking spaces accommodate visitors, customers, messengers, and other persons \nexpected to depart within approximately two hours. \nB. \nThe required minimum number of bicycle parking spaces for each principal use is given in Table \n9.0851.  Minimums are provided for both short-term and long-term standards. \n9.0831  Bicycle Parking Standards   \nA. \nLong-Term Bicycle Parking.

All long-term bicycle parking must be covered per Section 9.0832(D) below. \n4. \nSecurity.  To ensure security, long-term bicycle parking for all uses except schools must be in at \nleast one of the following locations: \na. \nA locked room;  \nb. \nAn area that is enclosed by a fence with a locked gate.

The purpose of these regulations is to provide the number, size, \nlocation, and screening requirements for loading areas in mixed-use, commercial, industrial and \ninstitutional uses.  The intent of these regulations is to minimize disruption of traffic flow by freight-\ncarrying vehicles blocking the public right-of-way and to minimize impacts to vehicular and pedestrian \ncirculation. \nB. \nWhen Loading Area Regulations Apply.  This regulation applies to all non-residential development in \nmixed-use, commercial, and industrial districts, whether or not a permit or other approval is required for \nthe development. \nC. \nGeneral Loading Area Regulations. \n1. \nLoading area requirements are provided in Table 9.0840(C).  The number of required loading \nspaces is based on the use of the building and the building size minus any residential component \nsquare footage.  Where two or more uses are located on the same premises, the number of loading \narea spaces required is the sum of the spaces required for each use (based on square footage of \neach use) computed separately.  Except in Design Districts as described below, the Manager may \nreduce but not eliminate loading area requirements, where approval criteria are satisfied. \n2. \nThe provision and maintenance of off-street loading facilities is a continuing obligation of the \nproperty owner. \n3. \nLoading and maneuvering areas shall be hard-surfaced unless a permeable surface is required to \nreduce surface runoff, as determined by the Manager. \n4. \nParking of passenger vehicles may be allowed in off-street loading areas subject to specific time \nlimits to prevent conflicts with off-street loading activities.  If parking is allowed, the parking time \nlimits shall be clearly posted.  These parking spaces shall not count towards meeting general \nparking requirements. \n5. \nRequired Off-Street Loading. \na. \nEach required off-street loading space in an industrial area shall have a minimum length \nof 60 feet, a minimum width of 12 feet, and a minimum vertical clearance of 15 feet \nhigh, inside dimensions with a 60-foot maneuvering apron. \nb. \nEach required off-street loading space, other than industrial zones, shall have a minimum \nlength of 30 feet, a minimum width of 12 feet, and a minimum vertical clearance of 14 feet \n6 inches high, inside dimensions with 30-foot maneuvering apron. \n6. \nLoading areas must comply with the setback and perimeter landscaping and screening standards.  \nWhen parking areas are prohibited or not allowed between a building and a street, loading areas \nare also not allowed unless approved by the Manager under special circumstances. \n7. \nUses not specifically mentioned:  In the case of a use not specifically mentioned, the requirements \nfor off-street loading facilities shall be the same as the above-mentioned uses, as determined by \nthe Manager, which is most similar to the use not specifically mentioned. \n",
