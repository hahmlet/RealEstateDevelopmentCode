Areas of the city determined \nappropriate for the following Residential Land Use District developments are identified on the Community \nDevelopment Plan Map. \nDevelopment of land in the following Residential Land Use Districts is permitted when development proposals \nare found to comply with the standards of this section and other relevant supplementary requirements of this \nordinance. \nLAND USE DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS \n4.0110 LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL-5 (LDR-5)  \nThe Low Density Residential-5 District is primarily intended for residential uses including single detached \ndwellings and manufactured homes, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, townhouses, and cottage clusters at a \nmaximum net density for single detached units of 8.71 units per acre and for townhouses of 25 units per acre.  \nFor all subdivisions, and for those partitions of parent parcels greater than 20,000 square feet, a minimum net \ndensity of 6.22 units per acre is required.   \n4.0111 LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL-7 (LDR-7) \nThe Low Density Residential-7 District is primarily intended for residential uses including single detached \ndwellings and manufactured homes, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, townhouses, and cottage clusters at a \nmaximum net density for single detached units of 6.22 units per acre and for townhouses of 25 units per acre. \nFor all subdivisions, and for those partitions of parent parcels greater than 20,000 square feet, a minimum net \ndensity of 4.35 units per acre is required. \n4.0112 TRANSIT LOW-DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (TLDR) \nThe Transit Low Density Residential District designation is applied primarily to existing low-density residential \nneighborhoods within close proximity of light rail and/or bus transit service and is intended for residential uses \nincluding single detached dwellings and manufactured homes, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, townhouses, \nand cottage clusters at a maximum net density for single detached units of 20 units per acre and for \ntownhouses of 25 units per acre. For all subdivisions, and for those partitions of parent parcels greater than \n13,000 square feet, a minimum net density of 10 units per acre is required.  This district is intended to \ncontinue as a lower-density neighborhood, with housing on small lots.  Manufactured dwelling parks are \nallowed at a maximum net density of 14 units per acre and a minimum net density of 7 units per acre. \n \n",

TR provides a \ntransition between these intensities while providing for a variety of housing types. The residential net density \nfor single detached units is 6.22 to 14.52 or 18.15 units per acre, depending on site size, and 25 units per acre \nfor townhouses. \n4.0114 MODERATE DENSITY RESIDENTIAL-12 (MDR-12) \nThe Moderate Density Residential District-12 is primarily intended for housing at a maximum net density for \nsingle detached dwellings of 12.1 units per acre, manufactured dwelling parks at a maximum net density of \n8.71 units per acre, and townhouses at a maximum net density of 25 units per acre.  Manufactured dwelling \nparks shall be designed in conformance with standards and procedures of the Oregon Department of \nConsumer and Business Services, Building Codes Division as contained in Oregon Administrative Rules Chapter \n918 Div. 600.  Where standards of OAR 918-600 conflict with the following standards, the more restrictive \nstandard shall apply.   \n4.0115 MODERATE DENSITY RESIDENTIAL-24 (MDR-24) \nThe Moderate Density Residential District-24 is primarily intended for middle housing and multifamily housing \nat a maximum net density of 24.2 units per acre and a minimum net density of 12.1 units per acre.  Some non-\nresidential uses may also be permitted within this district.  \n4.0116 OFFICE/RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (OFR) \nThe Office/Residential District is primarily intended for business offices, professional clinics, middle housing, \nand multifamily housing at a minimum net density of 8.71 units per acre and a maximum net density of 12.1 \nsingle detached units per acre or 25 townhouse units per acre. \n4.0120 PERMITTED USES \nTable 4.0120 lists those uses that are permitted in each Residential Land Use District.   \n\u2022 \nP = Permitted use \n\u2022 \nL = Use is permitted, but is limited in the extent to which it may be permitted \n\u2022 \nNP = Use not permitted \n\u2022 \nSUR = Use permitted subject to a Special Use Review \nEach of these uses must comply with the land use district standards of Section 4.0130-4.0137 and all other \napplicable requirements of the Community Development Code. \n \n",
