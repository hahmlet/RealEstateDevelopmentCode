The city of \nGresham benefits from a large number of trees consisting both of natural growth and those planted throughout \nthe years. The retention and establishment of trees adds to the livability of the community by enhancing its \naesthetic beauty, minimizing surface water and groundwater run-off and diversion, filtering noise and air \npollution, and promoting soil stability. Because uncontrolled cutting or destruction of trees within the city \ndecreases the community\u2019s livability, it is in the public interest to preserve significant trees, to control the \ncutting of trees, and to protect trees from damage during construction and from improper pruning. \n9.1012  Applicability  \nAll land within the city of Gresham is subject to the Tree Protection, Removal and Replacement regulations of \nSection 9.1000. \nA. \nWithin the Hillside and Geologic Risk Overlay and the Natural Resource Overlay regulations regarding \ntrees are as specified in Sections 5.0200 and 5.0700 respectively. This section applied within those \noverlays when specified in the overlay code. \nB. \nUnless otherwise noted, Tree Regulation standards marked as applicable to Other Uses do not include \nSingle Detached Dwellings and Middle Housing. Other Uses include but are not limited to: \n\u2022 \nMultifamily \n\u2022 \nElderly housing and residential facilities \n\u2022 \nManufactured dwelling parks \n\u2022 \nCommercial uses \n\u2022 \nIndustrial uses \n\u2022 \nInstitutional uses \n\u2022 \nLand divisions (not including middle housing land divisions) \nC. \nUnless exempted per Section 9.1013, the tree regulation standards of Section 9.1000 marked as \napplicable to Existing Development shall apply to activities such as, but not limited to: \n\u2022 \nTree removal not associated with a land use permit or building permit on a previously \ndeveloped site \nUnless exempted per Section 9.1013, the tree regulation standards of Section 9.1000 marked as \napplicable During Development shall apply to activities such as, but not limited to: \n\u2022 \nTree removal not associated with a land use permit or building permit on an undeveloped site \n\u2022 \nTree removal performed in conjunction with a land use permit or building permit \nD. \nNote: Most images, including photographs and illustrations that follow, are not part of the Development \nCode and do not act as Standards, unless labeled with a Development Code section number. These \nimages are provided to assist the readers in envisioning the intent of the standards. \n9.1013 Exemptions  \nA. \nRemoval of Regulated Trees will require either a Type 1 or Type II Tree Removal Permit, or a tree \nremoval exemption form.
