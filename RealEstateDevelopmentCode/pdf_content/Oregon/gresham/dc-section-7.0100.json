For example, landscaping guidelines and standards \nmay apply when new landscaping is being added. Guidelines and standards in Section \n7.0103(B) apply to buildings that were constructed prior to November 16, 2010, as de\u00ad\ntermined by the Manager or Design Commission. For Sections 7.0103(A) and (B), site and \nbuilding modifications needed to comply with Section 8.0200 shall comply with applica\u00ad\nble guidelines and standards.\nB. \t Purpose:\nThe Corridor Design District Design Review Principles, Guidelines, and Standards help \nfacilitate attractive, innovative, high-quality, sustainable development; encourage \nmulti-modal transportation; and promote livability and public safety, thereby fostering \nquality environments and a sense of community throughout the City.\nC. \t Design Review Process:\nProjects subject to design review, as described in Article 7 Design Review, are either \nbrought before the Design Commission or administered by the Manager. For projects \nsubject to 7.0103 the Design Commission or the Manager shall make findings and \ndecisions concerning conformance with the Design Guidelines and/or Standards, based \non which review process is selected.

If the Clear and Objec\u00ad\ntive Track is chosen, the applicant must meet all applicable development standards. \nDeviation from any of the standards in Section 7.0103 (choosing to follow one or \nmore guidelines) means the application is using the Discretionary Track.\na.\t The Discretionary Track: \nThe Discretionary Track is intended for particularly creative proposals that might \nnot comply with all or some of the Standards in Section 7.0103. The aim is to \nencourage applicants to propose exciting, innovative designs, while still ensuring \nthe City\u2019s design concerns and objectives for new development are met. In this \ncase, applicants shall meet the Design Guidelines. The Design Commission may \nwaive a Guideline or Guidelines to achieve the flexibility necessary to support a \nparticularly creative proposal. Approval requires that the applicant demonstrate \nto the Design Commission that the waiver from the Guideline(s) would result in \na development that better meets the applicable Design Principles and the intent \nstatement preceding the Guidelines.\nb.\t The Clear and Objective Track: \nThe Clear and Objective Track includes measurable Standards to meet the \ndesired urban form. The Standards ensure a degree of order, scale, and \nproportion within the built environment. That said, the Standards are written \nin a way to offer choices and allow for projects that are interesting and of \nsuperior design as individual buildings, while also contributing to a cohesive \nneighborhood. A decision on approval will come from the Manager or Design \nCommission. Deviation from any of the Standards will require the applicant to \nfollow the Discretionary Track.\n2.\t Layout: \nThe design Principles, Guidelines, and Standards are divided into two primary \ncategories:\na.\t Site Design: \nSite Design Guidelines and Standards address the organization and arrangement \nof a development\u2019s components. They focus on the location and orientation \nof buildings, parking, service areas, landscaping, and site features such as \nopen space. Good site planning is of critical importance to the design of new \ndevelopment. Excellent site design can improve the aesthetics of a community, \nminimize a project\u2019s impacts on its neighbors, improve the quality of the \nstreetscape, relate to or establish desirable development patterns, promote \nsustainability, and improve neighborhood connectivity.\nb.\t Building Design: \nBuilding Design Guidelines and Standards address the massing and exterior \narchitectural elements of buildings, including components that define the scale, \nquality, and character of a building, such as roofs, entries, windows, materials, \nand details. Excellent building design enhances the quality of life for residents \nby improving the appearance of the City, by establishing a sense of community, \nby minimizing negative environmental impacts, and by improving the long-term \neconomic value of the properties.\n",

Design Guidelines provide the opportunity for creative design \nflexibility.\nThe Design Standards are the objective requirements for development in design \ndistricts that are based on Design Principles. Design Standards provide a clear \nand objective way of evaluating the acceptability of a project\u2019s design.\nFor each item, either the Guideline or the Standard shall be followed. Guidelines \ncorrespond to the Standard of the same number and vice versa. For example, \nthe fifth Guideline corresponds with the fifth Standard (such that a Guideline \nnumbered \u2018G5\u2019 corresponds with the Standard \u2018S5\u2019).

When this is not possible, \nwindows which provide views of \ndisplays within the building may be \nacceptable.\nDesign Standards\nCommercial, Industrial, and Institutional\nS3.\t Exterior windows shall have a minimum of 4 inch reveal \n(depth), as measured from the exterior most window pane \nand the adjacent finish building plane, to create a shadow line \nthat highlights materials and the thickness of the wall. \nS4.\t Buildings shall have a pedestrian level transparency zone \nutilizing clear glass between the heights of zero and 12 feet for \nno less than 60 percent of facades facing public streets.\nS5.\t Non-street facing facades with customer entries shall have \na pedestrian level transparency zone utilizing clear glass \nbetween the heights of zero  and 12 feet for 40 percent of \nthe wall area within 30 feet of the entry (as measured from \nthe center of the doorway).  The length of this enhanced \ntransparency zone may be reduced to the end of the tenant \nspace that utilizes the entry if the transparency zone extends \nbeyond that tenant\u2019s space.\na.\t Outside the enhanced transparency zone, building shall \nhave a pedestrian level transparency zone utilizing clear \nglass between the heights of zero and 12 feet for no less \nthan 20 percent of facades with customer entries.\nS6.\t Display windows that do not provide views into the \ncommercial space may count towards up to 25 percent of \nthe pedestrian level transparency requirement if the display \nextends a minimum of four 4 feet into the building and \ncontains three dimensional (3D) objects such as product \ndisplays. Window boxes added to the exterior of the building \nare not permitted.\n5.\t Transparency, Continued\nFig. B.5.S4.  High levels of transparency add interest by allowing views into active \nspaces within the building.\nFig. B.5.S2: Decorative perforated metal panels are \nused along the street facing facade of a ground level \nparking structure to screen the interior.\n",
