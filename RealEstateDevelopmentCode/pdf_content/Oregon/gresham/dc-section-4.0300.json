Examples of professional services that cater to \ndaily general public customers include bank branches, financial, insurance, real estate, legal, medical and dental \noffices.   \n In order to ensure that these uses are primarily intended to serve the needs of workers in the immediate area the \nfollowing standards apply: \n  The total gross leasable square footage shall not exceed 3,000 square feet per use and shall not exceed 5,000 square \nfeet cumulative gross leasable square footage within the same development project. For the purposes of this section, a \ndevelopment project is: a) a single building with less than 50,000 square feet of gross floor area that does not share \ncommon development features (such as access, parking, or utilities) with another building that has less than 50,000 \nsquare feet of gross floor area, whether or not the second building is located on the same or a different parcel or lot; or b) \nmore than one building with less than 50,000 square feet of gross floor area that shares common development features \n(such as access, parking, or utilities) with another building that has less than 50,000 square feet of gross floor area, \nwhether or not the buildings are located on the same or a different parcel or lot; or c) a single building with 50,000 square \nfeet or more of gross floor area. \n  Shall not be permitted in a stand-alone building and instead be included within a building whose primary purpose is for \nan industrial use. \n3. \nOnly administrative offices which are related to the operation of the industrial use of the property are permitted in the \nHI. Up to 20% of the total floor area may consist of these administrative offices. Multiple tenant office buildings are \nprohibited. \n4. \nAuto and truck salvaging and wrecking are not permitted in GI. All other miscellaneous industrial uses located adjacent \nto properties that are residentially designated land shall be located at least 100 feet from the residential property.  \n5. \nWaste Management uses are permitted uses, except for solid waste transfer station, composting facilities, and landfills, \nwhich are subject to a Special Use Review.  When located in the GI, waste management uses adjacent to residentially \ndesignated land shall be located at least 100 feet from the residential property. \n6. \nThe following Community Service Uses are not permitted in the HI and GI districts: adult or senior centers, drug and \nalcohol treatment facilities, cemeteries, and mausoleums. \n7. \nThe following Parks, Open Spaces, and Trails are not permitted in the HI and GI districts: public urban plazas, public \nneighborhood parks, public community parks, and golf courses.  However, public urban plazas, public neighborhood \nparks, and public community parks are permitted in the HI and GI districts when an applicant demonstrates that title for \nthe parcel(s) where the facility is to be developed was held by the governing body for the applicant as of April 2, 2009. \n8. \nReligious institutions, elementary schools, middle schools and high schools are permitted in the HI and GI districts \nwhen an applicant demonstrates that title for the parcel(s) where the facility is to be developed was held by the \ngoverning body for the applicant as of April 2, 2009. \n9. \nSee Section 10.900 for additional standards that apply. \n10.

The implementation of Green \nDevelopment Practices detailed in the Stormwater Management Manual will minimize local and \ndownstream flooding, improve water quality, and protect aquatic habitat to the maximum extent \npracticable. \nA. \nStormwater runoff from new or redevelopment shall be managed on-site with Green \nDevelopment Practices and Green Streets to the maximum extent practicable. Green \nDevelopment Practices shall be designed in accordance with the requirements set forth in the \nStormwater Management Manual and Green Streets shall be designed in accordance with the \nPublic Works Standards.  \nB. \nSubmittal Requirements Prior to Tentative Land Division or Site Design Approval.  Prior to \ntentative land division or site design approval, applicants for new or redevelopment must submit a \nstormwater report with the development permit application.
