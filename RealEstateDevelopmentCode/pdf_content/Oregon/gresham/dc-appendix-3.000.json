The guarantee(s) required by this section or any other section of this code \nshall be in the form of a bond, or other security acceptable to the Manager.  The Manager may elect to \naccept a guarantee of completion that covers more than one obligation.  Upon acceptance by the City, the \nguarantee of completion shall be released or returned. \nA3.002  Noncompliance with Obligation \nIf the work or any portion of the work guaranteed is not completed in accordance with applicable \nrequirements within the period specified, the guarantee may be used by the City to complete the work and \ncover City costs. \nA3.003  Insufficiency of Guarantee of Completion and Warranty Guarantee \nA. \nIf a guarantee of completion required by this code is not sufficient to compensate the City for \nexpenses necessary to fulfill the obligation, the amount due to the city for the obligation shall \nbecome a lien in favor of the City upon the real property subject to the obligation. \nB. \nThe lien attaches upon the entry in the city records of the claim notice.  The notice shall state the \namount due, demand payment, allege the insufficiency of the guarantee of completion to \ncompensate the city fully for the expense of the fulfillment of the obligation, and allege the \napplicant's failure to meet the obligation. \nC. \nThe lien may be foreclosed in the manner prescribed by law for foreclosing other liens on real \nproperty. \n \n",
