It is also recognized that Gresham is comprised of many districts and \nneighborhoods \u2013 each one unique with distinct physical, social, and economic conditions and \nspecial assets to build upon to attract quality investment. Therefore, certain districts have \ntheir own design standards and guidelines to address design concerns that have cultural, \narchitectural, or even market significance to that area. \nThe vision for the Civic Neighborhood is for it to be made up of a distinctively urban mixture \nof uses and people. Inviting, tree-lined streets lead past lively storefronts and high quality \nbuildings with convenient places to live, work, and shop. The neighborhood\u2019s parks and \nplazas provide great places to gather, while its active transportation network provides easy \naccess to regional trails, Downtown, surrounding neighborhoods, and the greater metro \narea. The Civic Neighborhood Plan District Design Manual will help implement that vision, \nproviding specific urban design strategies and recommendations that raise the bar for design \nexcellence in the built environment. This document aims to inspire and guide development \nproposals toward meeting this goal. \nThe Civic Neighborhood Plan District Design Manual provides development regulations for \nthe neighborhood that promote good site and building design, facilitating the development \nof high quality, attractive, innovative, sustainable, and livable developments that foster \na true sense of community. Where there is a conflict between the provisions of the Civic \nNeighborhood Plan District and those of other provisions of the Community Development \nCode, the Civic Neighborhood Plan District\u2019s provisions shall take precedent. \nA.\t Design Review Process\n\t\nNew development, additions, and remodels within the Civic Neighborhood sub-districts \nare subject to design review as described in Article 7 Design Review for determination of \nconsistency with the guidelines and/or standards contained in this Code. Projects subject \nto design review are either brought before the Design Commission or administered by \nthe Manager. Either the Design Commission or the Manager shall make findings and \ndecisions concerning conformance with the design standards and/or guidelines based on \nwhich review track is selected.\n1.\t Two Tracks\nThe City has set up two alternative Design Review tracks: \n\u2022\t\nThe Discretionary Track; and \n\u2022\t\nThe Clear and Objective Track. \nApplicants have the choice of complying with either option. If the Clear and Objec\u00ad\ntive Track is chosen, the applicant must meet all development standards. Deviation \nfrom any of the standards in 4.1250 (choosing to follow one or more guidelines) \nmeans the application is using the Discretionary Track. \na.\t Clear and Objective Track: The Clear and Objective Track includes measurable \nregulations used in a predictable review process to meet the desired urban \nform. The standards ensure a degree of order, scale, and proportion within the \nbuilt environment. That said, the standards are written in a way to offer choices \nand allow for projects that are interesting and of superior design as individual \nbuildings while also contributing to a cohesive neighborhood.\n",

      "text": "Civic Neighborhood \nPlan District Design Manual\nCity of Gresham Development Code\nIntroduction\n[4.1200] - 3\n(06/22)\nb.\t Discretionary Track: The Discretionary Track is intended for applicants that \nwould prefer to propose a high quality project that might not comply with \nsome or all of the standards in 4.1250. The aim is to encourage applicants \nto propose exciting, innovative designs while still ensuring the City\u2019s design \nconcerns and objectives for development in Civic Neighborhood are met. In this \ncase, applicants shall meet the design guidelines. The Design Commission may \nwaive a guideline or guidelines to achieve the flexibility necessary to support a \nparticularly creative proposal. Approval requires the applicant to demonstrate \nto the Design Commission that the waiver from the guideline(s) would result \nin a development that better meets the applicable Civic Neighborhood Design \nPrinciples and the intent statement preceding the guidelines.\nB.\t How to Use the Code\n\t\nThis document provides the sub-district development standards for new development \nand re-development within the Civic Neighborhood Plan District, and guides the Design \nReview of projects within the Civic Neighborhood as described in Article 7 Design \nReview. It has four sections:\n1.\t Design Principles\nThe Section 4.1210 Design Principles are the general, over-arching statements \nand considerations that guide the design of the built environment in the Civic \nNeighborhood Design District. The Guidelines and Standards are written to support \nand carry out the Principles on a project-specific level. In instances where the \napplicant chooses the Discretionary Track, the relevant Principles will be reviewed \nfor compliance during the decision-making process.\n2.\t Civic Neighborhood Sub-Districts and Development Standards\nSections 4.1220 and 4.1230 describe the land use sub-districts in the Civic \nNeighborhood and the applicable basic Development Standards. The Development \nStandards prescribe the basic building envelope and site requirements necessary \nto ensure compact forms of development appropriate for an urban environment. \nThese Standards include permitted uses, building heights, floor area ratios, densities, \nsetbacks, and other basic regulations.\n3.\t Street Type Standards\nThe Section 4.1240 Street Types are indicated on the Civic Neighborhood Street \nTypes Map. When consulting the Code, project applicants shall look at the Street \nType Map for their project site to determine the Street Type. The respective Street \nType Standards provide important direction concerning building locations and \nrelationships to adjacent streets, efficient multi-modal circulation, and the provision \nof public spaces and pedestrian amenities. The Street Type standards are not \ndiscretionary. The cross sections shown are conceptual, and specific engineering \ndetails are found in the City\u2019s Public Works Standards. Developments must comply \nwith the Public Works Standards. \n",

The Civic Neighborhood Guidelines and Standards are divided into \nSite Design and Building Design sections, each of which includes several topics \naddressing a particular set of design considerations for the neighborhood. \na.\t Site Design: Site Design Guidelines and Standards primarily address the \norganization and arrangement of a development\u2019s components. They \nfocus on the location and orientation of buildings and site features such as \nparking, service areas, landscaping, and open space. Good site planning can \nimprove the aesthetics of a community, minimize a project\u2019s impacts on its \nneighbors, improve the quality of the streetscape, reflect or establish desirable \ndevelopment patterns, promote sustainability, and enhance neighborhood \nconnectivity.\nb.\t Building Design: Building Design Guidelines and Standards address the massing \nand exterior architectural elements of buildings, including components that \ndefine the scale, quality, and character of a building, such as roofs, entries, \nwindows, materials, and details. Excellent building design enhances the quality \nof life for residents by improving the appearance of the city, by establishing a \nsense of community pride, and by improving the long-term economic value of \nthe properties.\nFor each topic included in the Site Design and Building Design sections, there is an \nintroductory statement describing the design intent and a list of all Design Principles \nthat apply to that particular topic, followed by specific Guidelines and Standards. \nThe intent statement describes what the Guidelines and Standards are designed to \nachieve and sets expectations for high quality site and building design. \nThe Design Guidelines are the discretionary design parameters for development that \nprovide a statement of intent by which to evaluate the acceptability of a project\u2019s \ndesign. Design Guidelines provide the opportunity for creative design flexibility.\nThe Design Standards are the objective requirements for development in design \ndistricts that are based on Design Principles. Design Standards provide a clear and \nobjective way of evaluating the acceptability of a project\u2019s design. \nFor each item either the Guideline or the Standard shall be followed. Guidelines \ncorrespond to the standard of the same number and vice versa. For example, the \nfifth guideline corresponds with the fifth standard (such as a guideline labeled \n\u201cG5\u201d corresponding with standard \u201cS5\u201d). Sub-bullets under the Guidelines do not \nnecessarily correlate to sub-bullets of the same letter under the corresponding \nStandard.\n5.\t Images\nMost images, including photographs and illustrations, are not part of the \nDevelopment Code and do not act as Guidelines or Standards. These images are \nprovided to assist readers in envisioning the intent and potential outcomes of the \nGuidelines and Standards. Images that are not part of the Development Code are \nlabeled as figures. Images that are part of the Development Code will be labeled \nwith Development Code section numbers.\n",

The principles establish the fundamental \ndirection to guide future design and development in the Civic Neigh\u00ad\nborhood, and set the tone for the design guidelines and standards. \nA.\t Reflect Neighborhood Identity: Natural features, public spaces, \nactive streetscapes, and high quality, timeless developments \ncreate a strong neighborhood identity and sense of place. \nHigh levels of development intensity establish a district that is \nattractive, stimulating, active, and safe. \nB.\t Support a Mixed-use Community: Developments provide \na rich mixture of complementary uses including a variety of \ncommercial, residential, and institutional uses supporting a \nconvenient, urban lifestyle. This mix of uses and variety of \nhousing types supports a diverse population, generates 18-hour \nactivity, and provides options for jobs, housing, shopping, and \nservices.\nC.\t Provide Pedestrian and Transit Orientation: Pedestrian-oriented \ndesigns support and encourage multi-modal transportation \noptions including walking, driving, biking, transit, and other \nmodes in a functional, safe, and visually attractive manner.\nD.\t Create Active Streetscapes: Building, site, and street designs \nsupport multi-modal users, are scaled appropriately for their \nlocation, and promote active and engaging streets and public \nspaces at the pedestrian level. \nE.\t Enhance Connectivity: Interconnected streets, sidewalks, transit \nroutes, and trails form a pedestrian friendly transportation \nnetwork to and within the neighborhood, which is convenient, \nsafe, and accessible by multiple modes of travel. \nF.\t Integrate Public Amenities and Green Spaces: Integrate a wide \nvariety of interconnected public areas, parks, plazas, green \nspaces, and other landscape features which connect to nearby \nstreets and trails, create a sense of identity, support urban tree \ncanopy, and serve as centers of activity and social interaction. \nG.\t Utilize Sustainable Development Practices: Developments \nutilize best practices to promote the efficient and equitable use \nof land and resources; conserve and protect mature trees, water, \ntopography, and wildlife habitat; minimize energy usage and life \ncycle costs; support residents\u2019 health; and maximize a building\u2019s \npositive impact on the built and natural environment. \nH.\t Promote High Quality Design: Create aesthetically pleasing, \ndurable architecture with diverse, innovative designs that \nenliven the public realm and contribute to the sense of place, \nneighborhood, and pride in the City. \nI.\t\nDesign at a Human Scale: Promote development that is oriented \ntowards and welcoming to pedestrians, creates a strong \nrelationship between the building and the street, and creates \nenjoyable, pedestrian scaled spaces and streetscapes for people \nto occupy. \nFig. A:  Reflect neighborhood identity\nFig. D: Create active streetscapes\nFig. H: Promote high quality design\nFig. I:  Design at a human scale\n",

Areas designated CNRM are moderate to high density residential uses, with \na lower scale fronting NW Wallula Avenue. Typical forms of housing include row houses, gar\u00ad\nden apartments, condominiums, and multifamily apartments. Commercial uses are allowed \nto locate on sites fronting an Arterial Street.\n4.1223 Civic Neighborhood Transit Moderate Density (CNTM)\nThe CNTM sub-district includes convenient access to arterial streets as well as local and \nregional transit routes including light rail stations, bus lines, and bike and pedestrian paths. \nThis sub-district is intended to evolve over time from a shopping center largely organized \naround automobile trips and parking, into a full-service area with a diverse mix of jobs, hous\u00ad\ning, and commercial opportunities. The sub-district allows for the widest range of intensities \nin the neighborhood, supporting diverse projects with varied uses, scales, and ownership \nstructures.\n4.1224 Civic Neighborhood Transit High Density (CNTH)\nThis sub-district, centered around the two light rail stations, is the core of the Civic Neigh\u00ad\nborhood and permits the highest intensity of development. This walkable urban center \nincludes a range of public spaces, paths, and amenities connected by active street fronts and \nmulti-modal paths. The CNTH sub-district includes an active, engaging mix of uses \u2013 retail, \nservice, office, and residential - that will help create a vibrant area that is active all day and \nthrough the evening. \n4.1225 Split-Zoned Development Sites\nWhen a single development site is affected by both the CNTM and the CNTH sub-districts, \nthose areas of the site may be developed in conformance with permitted uses and develop\u00ad\nment standards of either the CNTM or the CNTH sub-district. If a split-zone property includes \na portion in the CNRM district, that portion shall be developed according to the CNRM stan\u00ad\ndards. \n",

Street design features and building-to-street relationships \nwill support the development of the Civic Neighborhood as pedestrian-oriented and transit-\nsupportive. Special features have been incorporated into several street design classifications \nincluded in this document. \nThe 4.1243 Civic Neighborhood Streets and Future Streets map supersedes the \nTransportation System Plan Functional Classification Plan, and streets, accessways, and multi-\nuse pathways shall be constructed per the standards contained in Section 4.1243(A)-(E) and \nfollowing the Section 4.1250 Design Guidelines and Standards. \nThis section includes several different street types applied to streets throughout the Civic \nNeighborhood, recognizing that street design and how buildings interface with the street \nvaries based on function, location, land uses, and multi-modal capacity. These Street Type \nrequirements will ensure consistent application of appropriate treatments based on mixes \nof uses and levels of intensity throughout the sub-districts. This section includes standards \nfor the following Street Type designations listed in order of highest functional class to \nlowest (refer to Map 4.1243 for specific designations of each Civic Neighborhood street and \ndesignated future street):\n\u2022\t\nUrban Boulevard (Arterial)\n\u2022\t\nCivic Drive\n\u2022\t\nWallula Avenue\n\u2022\t\nCivic Neighborhood Connector\n\u2022\t\nCivic Neighborhood Local\nAs new streets are constructed or existing streets are redeveloped, environmentally friend\u00ad\nly features for stormwater management are required. See Street Types and the Gresham\u2019s \nPublic Works Standards for requirements.\n4.1242 Public Works Standards Coordination\nApplicants shall consult specific street engineering construction standards in the Public \nWorks Standards and the Stormwater Management Manual in combination with these Street \nType Standards and the street standards included elsewhere in the Gresham Community De\u00ad\nvelopment Code. If compliance with the standards results in a conflict between the Commu\u00ad\nnity Development Code and Public Works Standards, the Public Works Standards govern the \nstreet design. The Department of Environmental Services may grant exceptions to the Public \nWorks Standards through the Design Modification Process if the City receives benefit from \nthe suggested standard deviation.\nExisting curb-to-curb dimensions may vary from what is shown in street type cross sections. \nApplicants shall consult the Public Works Standards to determine how to implement the \nstreet type cross sections in different situations.\n",
