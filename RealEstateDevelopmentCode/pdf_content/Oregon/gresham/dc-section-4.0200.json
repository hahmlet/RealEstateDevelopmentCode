The district is intended to \nmeet the shopping and service needs of the immediate neighborhood and to have minimal negative \nimpacts on surrounding residential uses.  Areas determined appropriate for Neighborhood Commercial \nDistricts are identified on the Community Development Plan Map. \n4.0212  Central Rockwood and Corridor Districts \nAdditional Commercial Development Districts unique to the Corridor Districts are listed in Section \n4.0400.  The Gresham Community Development Plan map identifies the location of these additional \ndevelopment districts. \n \n",
