The purpose of this \nsection is to provide development standards for food carts that are in the interest of public health and safety. \nThe standards minimize barriers to Food Cart development and minimize costly site improvements, in \nrecognition that substantial investment in underutilized sites could excessively postpone site redevelopment. \n10.1602 APPLICABILITY \nA.
