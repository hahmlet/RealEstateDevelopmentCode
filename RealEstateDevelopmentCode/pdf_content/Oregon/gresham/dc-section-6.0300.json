A Planned Development (PD) is such a method of applying alternative development standards for \nresidential developments. \n6.0302 APPLICABILITY \nPD's shall be permitted for residential-only partition and subdivision developments in any of the following \nresidential zones that permit residential development:  VLDR-SW, LDR-5, LDR-7, LDR-PV, LDR-SW, TLDR and TR. \nOnly those housing types permitted as allowed uses in each district shall be allowed in PDs. \n \n",

Subdivision lot sizes are \nalso variable and may consist of large, mixed size, or small lots provided the maximum density of the district is \nnot exceeded.  A \u201cLarge Lot\u201d PD, for example, is a PD that creates larger than standard lot sizes for purposes of \nsingle detached and middle housing.  No maximum lot size is stipulated. \n6.0311 PD TENTATIVE PLAN APPROVAL CRITERIA  \nAn application for a tentative PD plan approval shall be made in conjunction with an application for Land \nDivision under Section 6.0200 of the Community Development Code, except that it shall be processed under \nthe Type III procedures.  In addition, PDs that include elements that require Design Review under Article 7 shall \nsubmit for Design Review concurrent with the PD application.  In approving a tentative PD plan, the approving \nauthority shall find compliance with the applicable sections of the Community Development Code. \nIn addition to the above, the application shall clearly provide satisfaction to all of the following: \nA. That the proposal needs to be processed as a PD instead of a standard subdivision or partition,  \nB. That the proposal implements the Purpose of this section (see Section 6.0301),  \nC. That all private open space areas have an approved conservation/maintenance plan, \nD. That the Development Standards in this section are met, and \nE. That the project design, building heights, bulk and scale is appropriate for this location, considering such \nelements as surrounding development and housing types, street system network and capacity, utility \navailability, and the physical and/or natural features of the site.  Such project design shall include \ntransitioning measures (lower to higher height, bulk, scale and density) or buffers, so that perimeter \nstructures of the PD are both comparable and compatible with adjacent residential development.  Note:  \nIn the case of Large Lot PDs, since the building bulks proposed for each lot may be larger and not \ncomparable to adjacent residential development, buffering measures (such as increased vegetation and \nsetbacks) may be required by the review body to ensure neighborhood compatibility and bulk separation. \n6.0312 MODIFICATION OF TENTATIVE PD PLAN APPROVAL  \nModification of the tentative PD plan approval shall be made under the Type II procedures unless it involves \nany of the following, in which case it shall be processed under the Type III procedures used for the tentative PD \nplan approval: \nA. An increase in the number of dwelling units approved as part of the tentative plan. \nB. A change in the mix of dwelling types. \nC. A reduction in the amount of approved open space area by 5% or more.  In no case, except by Type III \nvariance, shall the amount of land designated as open space fall below 25% of the gross land area within \nthe PD if there is no specified Special Purpose overlay district designation; 30% of the gross land area \nwithin the PD if there is a Floodplain, Hillside and Geologic Risk Overlay, Open Space, or Natural Resource \nOverlay designation. \n \n",

Open space that conserves steep slopes \nand/or natural areas shall allow limited access to preserve its natural features.   \nC. Proposed natural open space areas shall be located to maximize the preservation of the features identified \nin subsection (G). \nD. The open space areas may be either public open space or private common open space. \n1. Public open space must comply with requirements of Section 5.0500 of the Community Development \nCode. \n2. Private open space shall comply with the following criteria: \na. Open space easements transferring development rights are dedicated to the public;  \nb. A conservation/maintenance plan is provided that maintains all natural open space areas in a \nnatural condition with only minimal maintenance activity provided.  The plan shall be approved by \nthe City, maintained and implemented by the property owner, and kept as part of the City\u2019s site \ndevelopment file for the duration of the existence of the private open space area.

Streets \nprovided within a PD shall be public streets, unless it is determined by the City that neighborhood connectivity \nis not necessary for the provision of access through the PD to other properties, either for purposes of public \nsafety and/or efficiency of traffic circulation and access.  Public paths and trails identified as transportation \nfacilities in the Transportation System Plan shall be located within public rights-of-way or public access \neasements, unless otherwise approved by the City. Private streets may be allowed within a PD if the future \nstreet/neighborhood circulation plan demonstrates that connectivity is not necessary through the PD to other \nproperties (as described above), and, the applicant can demonstrate how on-going maintenance of the private \nstreets will be provided for.  All streets and public paths and trails shall be designed and constructed according \nto applicable standards of Appendix 5.000, Section A.5.400-Streets and the Public Works Standards document. \n6.0326 STREET TREES   \nStreet trees shall be provided for all streets within a PD following the standards of Section 9.1044 of the \nCommunity Development Code. \n6.0327 REQUIRED BUFFERS AND TRANSITIONING \nPDs are not exempt from applicable buffer provisions of Section 9.0100.  However, natural and landscaped \nopen space areas may substitute for required buffers via the alternative buffer plan provision of Section \n9.0110(F)(3).  The transitioning of housing types (lower to higher bulk, scale and density) is required at the \nperimeter of PD's regardless of whether or not a buffer is required by Section 9.0100.  Buffer or transition \nvariations may be considered as part of alternative buffer plan proposals. \n",

Large Lot PDs are not limited to just areas covered by Overlays.  In case of conflicts in standards, the more \nrestrictive standards shall apply, with the exception of subsection (D) below, which applies in any case. \nB. When clustering and/or attached housing are not proposed and site grading will not exceed the 55% of site \nlimit (if Hillside and Geologic Risk Overlay) as per Section 5.0210(B), the open space designation \nrequirement is not required for Large Lot PDs.  However, buffering or transition measures for compatibility \npurposes may be required by the review body for portions of Large Lot PDs, whether in Hillside and \nGeologic Risk Overlay or not, adjoining other developed areas. \nC. A minimum site size of 2 acres is required for establishment of a Large Lot PD. \nD. Large Lot PDs are not required to comply with minimum density or maximum lot size standards.  Large Lot \nPDs shall, however, have a minimum average lot size that is the same or greater than at least twice the \nminimum density standard of the primary land use district where proposed.  For example, the minimum \naverage lot size in LDR-5 for a Large Lot PD would be 14,000 square feet per lot and in TLDR it would be \n8,712 square feet per lot. \nE.
