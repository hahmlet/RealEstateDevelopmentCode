The Downtown will be the most active, intense and \nurban area in the city, with consistent building edges at or near the sidewalk that help \ncontribute to these qualities. This Development Code will help implement that vision, \nproviding specific urban design strategies and recommendations that raise the bar for \ndesign excellence in the built environment. Downtown public and private entities working \ntogether will make this vision for Downtown Gresham a reality. This document aims to \ninspire and guide development proposals toward meeting this goal. \nThe Development Code contains Design Guidelines and Standards that provide a \nframework within which to review projects in Downtown, aiding architects, designers, \ndevelopers and the community in understanding the City\u2019s urban design expectations. \nCity staff and the City\u2019s Design Commission are responsible for reviewing the design of \nnew and significantly modified buildings Downtown, evaluating their contribution to the \npublic\u2019s enjoyment of the building and the immediate vicinity.\nThe Design Guidelines and Standards contained in the Development Code provide the \nmeasures that the Design Commission and staff use to determine a proposal\u2019s success. \nWhere there is a conflict between the provisions of the Downtown Plan District and those \nof other provisions of the Community Development Code, the Downtown Plan District\u2019s \nprovisions control. \nA.\t Design Review Process:\n\t\nNew development and additions and remodels within the Downtown sub-districts \nare subject to design review as described in Article 7 Design Review for determination \nof consistency with the guidelines and/or standards contained in this Code. Projects \nsubject to design review are either brought before the Design Commission or \nadministered by the Manager. For projects subject to 4.1151 either the Commission \nor the Manager shall make findings and decisions concerning conformance with the \ndesign standards or guidelines, based on which review track is selected.\n1.\t \tTwo Tracks: \nThe City has set up two alternative Design Review tracks: \n\u2022\t\nThe Discretionary Track; and\n\u2022\t\nThe Clear and Objective Track. \n\nApplicants have the choice of complying with either option. If the Clear and \nObjective Track is chosen, the applicant must meet all development standards. \nDeviation from any of the standards in 4.1100 or referenced standards in Article 7 \nmean the application must use the Discretionary Track. \na.\t \tDiscretionary Track: The Discretionary Track is intended for applicants that \nwould prefer to propose a quality project that might not comply with all \nor some of the standards in 4.1100 or referenced standards in Article 7. \nThe aim is to encourage applicants to propose exciting, innovative designs, \nwhile still ensuring the City\u2019s design concerns and objectives for Downtown \ndevelopment are met. In this case, applicants shall meet the design \nguidelines. The Design Commission may waive a guideline or guidelines to \nachieve the flexibility necessary to support a particularly creative proposal. \nApproval requires the applicant to demonstrate to the Design Commission \nthat the waiver from the guideline(s) would result in a development that \nbetter meets the applicable Downtown Design Principles and the intent \nstatement preceding the guidelines.\nb.\t \tClear and Objective Track: The Clear and Objective Track includes measurable \nregulations used in a predictable review process to meet the desired urban \nform. The standards ensure a degree of order, scale and proportion within \n",

That said, the standards are written in a way to offer \nchoices and allow for projects that are interesting and of superior design as \nindividual buildings while also contributing to a cohesive Downtown district.\nB.\t \tHow to Use the Code:\n\t\nThis document guides the Design Review for any new Downtown project or projects \nthat exceed the limits described in Article 7 Design Review. It has four sections:\n1.\t \tDesign Principles: \nThe Design Principles are the general, over-arching statements and considerations \nthat guide the design of the built environment in design districts like Downtown. \nThe Guidelines and Standards are written to support and carry out the principles \non a project-specific level. In instances where the applicant chooses the \ndiscretionary process, the relevant principles will be reviewed for compliance \nduring the decision-making process.\n2.\t \tDowntown Sub-Districts and Development Standards: \nThis section describes the land use sub-districts in the Downtown and the \napplicable basic Development Standards. The Development Standards prescribe \nthe basic building envelope and site requirements necessary to ensure compact \nforms of development appropriate for an urban environment. These Standards \ninclude permitted uses, building heights, floor area ratios, densities, setbacks, \nbonus provisions and other basic regulations.\n3.\t \tStreet Type Standards\nA set of Street Types is included in this document. The Street Types are indicated \non the Downtown Street Types Map. When consulting the Code, project \napplicants shall look at the Street Type Map for their project site to determine \nthe Street Type. The respective Street Type Standards provide important direction \nconcerning building locations and relationships to adjacent streets, efficient multi-\nmodal circulation, and the provision of public spaces and pedestrian amenities. \nThe Street Type standards are not discretionary. The cross-sections shown are \nconceptual and specific details of street design and engineering are found in the \nCity\u2019s Public Works Standards. Developments must comply with the Public Works \nStandards. \n4.\t \tDowntown Design Guidelines and Standards\nThe Downtown-Wide Guidelines and Standards are divided into Site Design \nand Building Design sections, each of which include several topics addressing a \nparticular set of design considerations for Downtown. For each topic, there is an \nintroductory statement describing the design intent, a list of all Design Principles \nthat apply to that particular topic, followed by specific Guidelines or Standards. \n\nThe intent statement describes what the Guidelines and Standards are designed \nto achieve and sets expectations for high-quality site and building design. \n\nThe Design Guidelines are the discretionary design parameters for development \nthat provide a statement of intent by which to evaluate the acceptability of a \nproject\u2019s design. Design Guidelines provide the opportunity for creative design \nflexibility.\n\nThe Design Standards are the objective requirements for development in design \ndistricts that are based on Design Principles. Design Standards provide a clear and \nobjective way of evaluating the acceptability of a project\u2019s design. \na.\t Site Design:\nSite Design Guidelines and Standards primarily address the organization and \narrangement of a project\u2019s components in two dimensions. They deal with \nthe location of buildings and site features such as open space, landscaping, \nparking and service areas. Good site planning can minimize a project\u2019s impacts \non its neighbors, improve the quality of the streetscape, relate to or establish \ndesirable development patterns, promote sustainability and make better \nconnections.\n",

Great visual interest and innovative design are \ncritical elements of this principle, with buildings that assist in defining, enlivening the \npublic realm and accentuating the main Gateways into the Downtown. \nC.\t \tCreate a Unique and Exciting Public Realm: Emphasize building and site design \nelements that reinforce the experience of walking and biking, and promote active \nstreets and lively public spaces.

Context-sensitive redevelopment must take into account proximity to existing \nuses, height and massing relationships, surrounding building character, street widths \nand functions, open spaces, desired land uses and view corridors. \nG.\t \tPreserve and Enhance Historic Character: Where appropriate, new developments \nshall build on historic and other cultural assets by recognizing the smaller patterns of \nthe townscape without being historicist. \nH.\t \tCreate Appropriate Transitions in Height, Bulk and Scale: New development must \nstrive to be compatible in scale with its surroundings. Elements which contribute to \nthe perceived scale of new construction are addressed in the context of specific site \nconditions, as well as in relationships between sub-districts.\nI.\t \tIncrease Transportation Accessibility: Building, site and street design shall increase \naccessibility to and within the Downtown Plan area by encouraging transportation by \nmany modes including pedestrians, automobiles, bicycles, transit and other vehicles in \na functional and visually attractive manner.\n",

Main Avenue has a small-scale, walkable quality \nappreciated by residents and visitors. This sub-district is intended to preserve this small-\nscale character on Main Avenue while encouraging an active, engaging mix of old and new \nuses. \nThe DCC sub-district allows a wide range of uses \u2013 retail, service, office and residential \u2013 \nthat will help create a vibrant sub-district that is active all day and much of the night. \n4.1111 Downtown Mixed Use (DMU):\nThis sub-district is intended to evolve over time from a shopping center largely organized \naround automobile trips and parking into a mixed-use sub-district with jobs, housing and \ncommercial opportunities. This full-service sub-district will contain new shopping streets, \npublic spaces and better pedestrian and automobile connections to the DCC sub-district \nand to the Civic Neighborhood. \nThis DMU sub-district allows a mixture of employment, retail, office and residential uses in \na very dense, compact urban form by permitting the most intense, tallest development in \nDowntown.\n4.1112 Downtown Transit Mid-Rise (DTM):\nThis mixed-use sub-district provides a mid-rise, mixed-use character in the center of \nDowntown near the light-rail stations. Because of its proximity to transit, this sub-district \nprovides access opportunities for those who live Downtown to use buses and MAX light \nrail to get to jobs and other destinations. It also supports the creation of employment uses \nDowntown so those who live outside the Downtown have opportunities and easy access \nto work Downtown. \nThis sub-district supports the continued presence of institutional uses, such as \ngovernment offices. It also allows a mix of residential, commercial and employment uses \nat a mid-rise intensity.\n4.1113 Downtown Employment Mid-Rise (DEM):\nThis mixed-use area is envisioned as one that could support significant employment, \nwhether retail or office in nature. It has excellent access to light rail as well as several \nmajor streets \u2013 Hogan, Burnside, and Division. Buildings are allowed to have multiple \nstories with larger footprints here to accommodate market demand. \nThis sub-district allows for a substantial amount of general office, financial, corporate and \ninstitutional uses that employ large numbers of people. It also allows a significant retail \npresence and residential uses.\n4.1114 Downtown Residential Low-Rise-1 (DRL-1):\nThis mixed-use sub-district will encourage some residential areas to gently transform \ninto a broader mix of residential uses. This sub-district is intended to create distinctive, \nwalkable neighborhoods within a short distance of transit and the Downtown core.\nThe sub-district encourages single detached dwellings to remain and allows duplexes, \ntriplexes, quadplexes, townhouses, and cottage clusters, but not multifamily. This sub-\ndistrict also will allow small-scale commercial uses only on certain streets where it is most \nappropriate. \n",

The standards contained in this Table are supplemented by referenced \nsub-sections of 4.1100 which provide additional clarification and guidance. Existing \ndevelopments that do not meet the standards specified for a particular sub-district \nmay continue in existence and be altered, subject to provisions of Section 8.0200, \nExisting and Nonconforming Uses and Development. There are two key factors of \ndevelopment potentially allowable on parcels and development sites for each district \nwith the Downtown: building height and floor area ratio. To determine the development \npotential of a property, the FAR number is multiplied by the site area. For example: A \nsite area of 20,000 square feet multiplied by an FAR of 3.0 yields 60,000 square feet of \nfloor area that can be built on that site.\nA.\t Development on a site must achieve at least the Minimum Floor Area Ratio and can \nbuild up to the Maximum Floor Area Ratio. \nB.\t Additional FAR, shown in the Maximum Floor Area Ratio with Bonuses column, \ncan be achieved by including bonus elements and attributes (described in Section \n4.1131). Multiple bonus elements can be used in combination to achieve the \nmaximum FARs listed in the Maximum Floor Area Ratio with Bonuses column \nin Table 4.1130. Each bonus element can be used only once, unless otherwise \nindicated in the bonus element descriptions. This method allows for many \ncombinations of uses, intensities and different features within each development.\n1.\t With bonuses, residential-only buildings can achieve a maximum FAR up to \nwhat is shown in the Residential column under Maximum Floor Area Ratio \nwith Bonuses. Maximum heights cannot be exceeded in the DRL-1 and DRL-2 \ndistricts. \n2.\t With bonuses, buildings that do not include a residential use can achieve \na maximum FAR up to what is shown in the Non-residential column under \nMaximum Floor Area Ratio with Bonuses.\n3.\t With bonuses, buildings that combine both residential and non-residential uses \ncan achieve a maximum FAR up to what is shown in the combined column under \nMaximum Floor Area Ratio with Bonuses.\nC. \tFor purposes of minimum floor-area-ratio calculations in DCC, DMU and DTM, \napplicants may include the following in the ground-level floor area up to a total of \n1,000 square feet or 10 percent of the site, whichever is larger: \n1.\t Publicly accessible open space. \n2.\t Required minimum setbacks. \n3.\t Area removed from the first-floor building footprint to create corner features \nto comply with Section 4.1151(B)(8). For example, a beveled corner will have a \nslightly smaller footprint than a 90-degree corner because of the bevel. \n4.\t Areas between the minimum and maximum front setbacks for Commercial, \nIndustrial and Institutional uses that are provided for usable, pedestrian-\noriented uses such as walkways and outdoor dining areas.\nD. \tFor purposes of minimum floor-area ratio calculations in all sub-districts, the \nfollowing may be counted as ground-level floor area. \n1.\t Utility easements. \n2.\t Structured parking at grade or above.\n",
