The Manager shall grant a variance if all of the following \ncriteria are satisfied: \nA. \nThe need for the variance does not result from prior actions of the applicant or owner, or from personal \ncircumstances of the applicant or owner, such as financial circumstances. \nB. \nTo meet the need, the request is the minimum necessary variation from the Community Development \nCode requirement. \nC. \nThere are development constraints associated with the property, or the present use or permitted use of \nthe property, which make development of a permitted use impractical; or the variance is needed to allow \nthe applicant to enjoy a substantial property right possessed by a majority of property owners in the \nsame vicinity. \nD. \nThe purposes of the Community Development Code and the applicable policies of the Community \nDevelopment Plan would be equally met or advanced by a variation from the development requirement. \n10.1511  Type II Variance Provisions to the Floodplain Overlay District \nStandards \nThe Manager shall grant a variance is all of the criteria identified in Section 10.1510 and a determination can be \nmade that the granting of a variance shall only be issued by a community upon a showing of good and sufficient \ncause, that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and that the \ngranting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary \npublic expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local \nlaws or ordinances. \nA community shall notify the applicant in writing that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below \nthe base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance and increases risks to life and \nproperty. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. \nType II Adjustments \n10.1520  Reduction in Minimum Street Frontage  \nIntent.  The City\u2019s transportation policies assure public street connectivity in general, and specifically require \npublic street frontage and access for residential parcels. \nAdjustment.  However, the Manager under a Type II procedure may reduce the minimum street frontage \nrequired if 1) such reduction is necessary to satisfy neighborhood circulation and/or future street plan provisions \n(Section 9.0700), and 2) Associated findings show either condition (A) or condition (B) exists, and condition \n(C) exists: \nA. \nTopographical constraints preclude the application of the minimum standard; or \nB. \nThe land division is part of an infill process where the application of the minimum street frontage \nstandard would prohibit the division of the parcel.

Multifamily \ninclude solar space heating or water heating devices, or insulation beyond the minimum standards \nof the Building Code. \nB. \nUpon a finding that the applicant's plan substantially achieves any of the preceding criteria, the Manager \nmay modify the identified standards within the following prescribed limits: \n1. \nFront, side, and rear yards may be reduced to zero when in compliance with the Oregon State \nStructural Specialty Code. \n2. \nThe requirements for the installation of sidewalks may be modified if provisions are made to \nprovide off-street parking in addition to that required in the off-street parking section of this code, \nas follows: \na. \nDetached dwellings - two additional off-street parking spaces. \nb. \nAttached dwellings - for each unit, one-half additional off-street parking space for each \nbedroom in addition to the first bedroom.  In cases where a one-half space occurs in a \ntotal figure, the standards shall be increased to the next whole figure. \n3. \nHeight limitations may be increased, provided the additional height does not exceed 45 feet in a \nresidential district. Additional height cannot be approved under Section 10.1521 in the GBSV \nDistrict. \n4. \nBuilding lot coverage may be increased provided the additional coverage does not exceed 50 \npercent. \n5. \nParking requirements may be reduced by 10 percent. \n10.1522  Modification of Dedications and Other Requirements   \nUnder the Type II procedure, the Manager may reduce or eliminate a dedication of land or other requirement if \nthe requirement, as determined by the Manager, does not meet the requirements of the Fifth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. \nType III Variances \n",

Except for applications for a variance to maximum height in the GBSV District, \nwhere additional criteria apply, the hearing body shall grant the variance if all of the criteria identified in \nSection 10.1510 and one of the following criteria is met: \nA. \nThe circumstances that apply to the site or to the present or permitted use of the site do not typically \napply to other properties in the same vicinity or land use district and are unique or unusual; or, \nB. \nIt would be more detrimental to the public safety or more injurious to the public welfare to apply the \ndevelopment standard than to grant the proposed variance. \n10.1531  Private Residential Access for New Dwellings under Unit Ownership  \nPrivate residential access to a public street for new dwellings under unit ownership may be authorized under the \nType III procedure, if the proposal is consistent with the following criteria: \nA. \nThe proposed access shall not eliminate or make impractical the establishment of a planned public street \nor continuation of an existing public street.  The public circulation needs of the area within one-quarter \nmile shall be accommodated without a public street through the site. \nB. \nAdditional off-street parking shall be provided to dwellings served by an access in order to replace the \nlost on-street parking. \n10.1532  Type III Major Variance Provisions to Maximum Height in the GBSV \nDistrict  \nA. \nThe Planning Commission is the decision authority. \nB. \nApplicants must address the criteria located in Section 10.1510 and one of the criteria outlined in \nSection 10.1530 and comply with Section 10.1532.C.1 or Section 10.1532.C.2 as described below. \nC. \nThe structure shall not be visible from any parcels outside of the GBSV District.
