      "text": " \n[4.04]-2 \nCity of Gresham Development Code \n \n(01/2023) \nAction Plan, which called for this area to accommodate intensive commercial, residential, and mixed-use \ndevelopment.  Central Rockwood is envisioned as a Town Center, growing into a lively pedestrian-\noriented, transit-supportive district.  Transit Corridors are made up of lands adjacent to streets with transit \nservice, identified in Map 21, Volume IV \u2013 Transportation System Plan, of the Gresham Community \nDevelopment Plan.  The land use districts of both the Central Rockwood Plan and the transit corridors are \ndesigned to take advantage of the substantial public investments which have been made in transit service, \nand to create attractive places to live, work, shop, and recreate with less reliance on the automobile than \nmight be found elsewhere in the community. \nCorridor District Characteristics \n4.0410  Rockwood Town Center (RTC)  \nThis district encompasses the heart of Central Rockwood. It is centered on the triangle formed by E. \nBurnside, NE 181st Ave., and SE Stark St., but also takes in adjacent properties around the triangle.  \nPrimary uses permitted in RTC are retail commercial, services, office uses and housing. Mixed-use \ndevelopments and various institutional uses (e.g. library, public meeting halls, government facilities) are \nalso permitted. The scale and character of new development is intended to support and reinforce the \nimage of a town center, with buildings of at least two stories, oriented to streets and pedestrians, and with \nparking lots behind or to the sides of buildings. \n \nA portion of the Rockwood Town Center will be the focus of more concentrated high-density residential, \noffice, commercial, service and institutional mixed-use development in a village type urban form. Within \nthis area, proposals to develop multifamily structures and townhouses that front on streets are required to \nhave a mixed-use component along the street frontage. Mixed-use consists of commercial, office, or \ninstitutional uses or combinations thereof in combination with residential uses. This \u201cMixed-Use\u201d \nRockwood Town Center area consists of the \u201ctriangle\u201d described above, and other properties which front \non its abutting streets (see Appendix 9.000). \n4.0411  Station Centers (SC)  \nThis district takes in properties which are adjacent to, or within easy walking distance, of light rail \nstations at 162nd Avenue, 172nd Avenue, Ruby Junction (197th Ave.), and Gresham City Hall. The Station \nCenters district is intended to accommodate uses which are directly supportive of light rail transit. \nDevelopment types permitted include retail and service businesses, offices, mixed-use projects, higher-\ndensity housing, and townhouses. Acknowledging the different character of existing land uses adjacent to \nthe Ruby Jct. light rail station, an overlay designation here will also permit auto-dependent uses, and \nsmall-scale light industrial uses. \n4.0412  Corridor Multifamily (CMF)  \nThis district designation is applied to properties along segments of Transit Streets. The CMF district \nprimarily provides opportunities for moderate-density residential development, including multifamily and \nmiddle housing. It also allows single detached dwellings along the NE Glisan and NE 162nd Avenue \ncorridors. To help create a pleasant pedestrian environment, most new residential buildings will be \noriented to public sidewalks, with parking lots behind or beside buildings. Standards will require that the \nscale of new housing diminish as buildings approach abutting lower density residential districts. \n",

In addition to \nmoderate-density residential uses, the CMU district permits small-scale commercial uses and mixed-use \ndevelopments. Commercial businesses operating in this district will serve primarily the day-to-day needs \nof residents in nearby housing developments and neighborhoods. Design standards in Section 7.0400 for \nduplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, and townhouses, and in Section 7.0100 for new construction and \nremodels which meet the thresholds described in Section 7.0003 will help to ensure that new buildings \nbecome attractive additions to existing and developing neighborhoods. \n4.0414  Community Commercial (CC)  \nThis district designation is applied to larger nodes of primarily commercial development clustered around \nthe intersections of major and/or standard arterial streets. This district services the surrounding \ncommunity with a larger trade area than the Moderate Commercial district but still has building size \nlimitations for compatibility with the adjacent residential properties. The CC district will accommodate a \nwide range of community-scale commercial uses, including retail, services, and offices. This district also \npermits housing as a secondary use, with multifamily being developed in conjunction with commercial \nconstruction.  New buildings will be pedestrian-oriented, with parking placed behind or beside buildings. \nDesign Standards in Section 7.0100 for new construction and remodels which meet the thresholds \ndescribed in Section 7.0003 will help to ensure that new buildings become attractive additions to existing \nand developing neighborhoods.  \n4.0415  Moderate Commercial (MC)  \nThe MC district is applied to smaller nodes of commercial activity than the Community Commercial and \nis clustered around key intersections. This district is intended to function primarily as locally-oriented \ncenters serving smaller trade areas than the Community Commercial district.  Building size limitations \nensure compatibility with the surrounding neighborhoods. Permitted development types include \ncommercial retail, service, and office uses. This district also permits housing as a secondary use, with \nmultifamily being developed in conjunction with commercial construction. Design Standards in Section \n7.0100 for new construction and remodels which meet the thresholds described in Section 7.0003 will \nensure a strong pedestrian orientation for new development. \nPermitted Uses \n4.0420  Permitted Uses   \nTable 4.0420 lists those uses that are permitted in each Corridor Land Use District.   \n\u2022 \nP = Permitted use \n\u2022 \nL = Use is permitted, but is limited in the extent to which it may be permitted \n\u2022 \nNP = Use not permitted \n\u2022 \nSUR = Use permitted subject to a Special Use Review \nIn addition to the permitted commercial land use types listed in Table 4.0420, the manager, under the \nType II procedure, may permit other commercial uses which the manager finds to be supportive of, and \nconsistent with, the purposes of the Central Rockwood Plan (Appendix 39 of Volume 1) and Corridor \nDistricts (Section 4.0400), and with applicable land use policies and implementation strategies of the \nCommunity Development Plan. \n",
