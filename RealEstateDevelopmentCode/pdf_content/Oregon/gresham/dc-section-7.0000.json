The scope of Design Review reviews the proposed use, the exterior of the buildings, structures, and \nother development and the site on which the buildings, structures, and other development is located. \nB. All Design Review requests shall comply with all applicable standards in the Community Development \nCode.  Development which only affects a portion of a site shall conform with the applicable standards \nfor that portion of the site where development is proposed.  Where Nonconforming development exists \non part of a site (not being re-developed) compliance with the Standards applicable to Non-Conforming \nDevelopments in Section 8.0200 is required unless otherwise noted. \nC. In mixed-use projects, the standards and criteria for each component use as described in Section \n7.0100, Section 7.0200, Section 7.0300, Section 7.0400, and Section 7.0500 shall apply to the review of \neach component of the mixed-use proposal. \nD. Uses exempt from Design Review include: \n1. Single detached dwellings, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, townhouses, and cottage clusters in the \nLDR-GB, LDR-7, LDR-5, TR, TLDR, MDR-12, MDR-24, OFR, DRL-1, DRL-2, VLDR-SW, LDR-SW, THR-SW, \nLDR-PV, MDR-PV, and HDR-PV districts, as well as the areas of CMF along the NE Glisan and NE \n162nd Avenue corridors. \n2. Duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes in the CMU district and the areas of CMF not along the NE \nGlisan and NE 162nd Avenue corridors.  \n3. Accessory dwellings \n4. Minor basic utilities \n5. Portable classrooms \n6. Co-located antennas for a wireless communications facility \n7. Renewable energy systems except that the following standards discussing mechanical equipment \nplacement and screening apply: \n",

Exemption from Design Review does not exempt a development from meeting other relevant standards \nwithin the Community Development Code including but not limited to: district standards, transit \nstandards, non-conforming development standards, and public facilities standards. \nF. In Design Districts where standards and guidelines have been established, two tracks are available for \ndesign review. Under the clear and objective track, applications are evaluated using design standards.  \nUnder the discretionary track, applications are evaluated using design guidelines. \n7.0003 APPLICATIONS \nAn application for Design Review is subject to the highest possible level of review, given the thresholds for \ndifferent reviews described below.  Design Review A is the lowest level Design Review; Design Review E is \nthe highest level.  For uses not listed in Table 7.0003, the Manager shall determine which level of Design \nReview is appropriate. \nWhen there is a conflict in the noted Design Review permit types, the more restrictive shall apply. \nFor exemptions and exceptions see Section 7.0002, Section 8.0220 Changes to Nonconforming Uses and \nDevelopment, the applicability statements in individual design review district sections, and Section 11.0200 \nInitiation and Classification of Applications. \n",

Time Scope:  The Manager may authorize a time schedule for developing the various phases in periods \nof time in excess of two years, but in no case shall the total time period for all stages exceed seven \nyears.  Each stage shall conform to the applicable requirements of the Code.  \nC. When Modifications are Required:  Modifications may be required to portions of a Phased Design \nReview developed after the passage of one year to comply with change(s) in the Community \nDevelopment Code. Modifications are not required for components of the site approved and developed \nunder previous approvals. \nD. How Modifications are Reviewed:  A modification to a Phased Design Review to meet new Code \nstandards shall be reviewed through the highest applicable Design Review procedure specified in \nSection 7.0000. However, modifications are not subject to a pre-application conference or an early \nneighborhood meeting. Modifications must meet standards in the Development Code, unless meeting \n",

For proposals that were approved through the design review process in the area shown on Figure \n7.0005, a three-dimensional, basswood (or similar material as approved by the Manager) model of the \napproved proposal is required for new developments or for existing buildings where expansion will \nincrease the building footprint by more than 50 percent. \nB. The three-dimensional model of the proposal as approved must be submitted to be placed in the City\u2019s \nDowntown model prior to the issuance of a building permit. \nC. The scale of the model must be 1 inch equals 50 feet. \nD. The model requirements will be waived if the application does not involve a change in the bulk of \nbuildings on a site for which the City possesses an accurate model. \n(Figure 7.0005 follows) \n \n \n",
