The Plan Map designations are to be used as the basis for amending the Community \nDevelopment Plan Map.  The Community Development Plan Map is amended at time of annexation. Once the \nCommunity Development Plan Map is amended it becomes the basis for all land use decisions and \ndevelopment permits. \n \nThe Plan Map identifies the general boundaries for sub-districts.  Circulation and design elements are also \nshown to provide context and promote the integration of land use, transportation, and natural resources, and \nimplement the goals, policies, and recommended action measures in the Comprehensive Plan.  Amendments \nto the Community Development Plan must be consistent with the Plan Map and other applicable codes and \nregulations of the City. \n4.1403  PLEASANT VALLEY SUB-DISTRICTS IN GENERAL \nThe Plan District Sub-districts listed below apply to land in the Plan District.

The maximum front or street-side setback of up to 20 feet may be permitted when enhanced pedestrian spaces \nand amenities are provided. This requirement applies to commercial and mixed-use buildings. Where standalone \nresidential buildings are permitted, the maximum setback requirement does not apply. \n2. A height bonus applies to affordable housing development. See Section 10.1700. \n3. Building height transition standards apply when the abutting lot is in the LDR-PV sub-district. See Section 4.1416. \n4. For the purposes of screening and buffering a use permitted in the ME-PV shall be considered an office use.  \n4.1425  SETBACKS \nRequired minimum and maximum setback standards are specified in Table 4.1424(A). \nA. \nMinimum setback distances shall be determined in conformance with the definition for \u201cSetback\u201d as \nspecified in Section 3.0103. \nB. \nConformance with maximum setback distance is achieved for a commercial or mixed-use building \nwhen at least one primary entrance located on the fa\u00e7ade facing the street is placed no farther from \nthe property line than the distance specified for Maximum Building Setback in Table 4.1424(A).  \nMaximum building setbacks may be exceeded when a development incorporates enhanced pedestrian \nspaces and amenities in the setback area.  Enhanced pedestrian spaces and amenities consist of \nfeatures such as plazas, arcades, courtyards, outdoor cafes, widened sidewalks, benches, shelters, \nstreet furniture, public art, or kiosks.  In addition, on sites with more than one building, the maximum \nsetback may be exceeded, provided conformance is achieved with the maximum setback distance for \nat least one building. When phased development is proposed, buildings constructed during the initial \nphase(s) are exempt from this standard, provided the applicant demonstrates that buildings proposed \nfor a later phase(s) will fulfill the maximum setback requirement.  \n4.1426  BUILDING HEIGHT \nMaximum building heights are specified in Table 4.1424(A).   \nA. \nThe maximum building height shall be reduced when located adjacent to the LDR-PV district, as \nprovided in Section 4.1416. \n4.1427  TRANSIT DESIGN CRITERIA AND STANDARDS \nThese sub-districts are pedestrian districts.  As such, new development must have a strong orientation to the \npedestrian and be transit-supportive, as well as enhance the appearance and functioning of these sub-districts. \nA. \nIn order to achieve these purposes, the following design regulations apply: \n1. Section 7.0103 applies to new multifamily, elderly housing, residential facilities, commercial, \nmixed-use, and industrial development requiring design review approval. The commercial \ndesign standards in Section 7.0103 shall apply to industrial development. \n2. Section 7.0432 applies to new townhouse projects.  \n",
