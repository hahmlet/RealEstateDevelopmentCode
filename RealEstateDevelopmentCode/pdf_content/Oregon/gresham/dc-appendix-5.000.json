A \ndevelopment may be required to modify or replace existing off-site systems to provide adequate public facilities. \nThe Manager shall have the authority to review designs, approve plans, inspect construction and accept public \nimprovements, for City ownership, operation and maintenance. The Manager may establish administrative \nprocedures for the above process in order to protect the life, safety, and welfare of the public. \nA5.002  DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS   \nDesign and construction of all public facility improvements shall be in accordance with the Gresham Community \nDevelopment Code, Gresham Public Works Standards and the approval conditions of the applicable development \npermit(s). The Gresham City Council shall adopt the Gresham Public Works Standards by Resolution. \nA5.003  GUARANTEE OF COMPLETION   \nA. \nPrior to approval of any final map or plat, the required public improvements must be completed and all \ndevelopment fees and charges must be paid, or a Guarantee of Completion shall be required to ensure \nthe completion of or payment for: public improvements; all required private water quality and detention \nfacilities; and payment of development fees and charges.  Prior to construction of any privately financed \npublic improvement, a Guarantee of Completion shall be required for all improvement costs, including \ngrading and erosion prevention, other than those improvements constructed on private property which \nwill become public upon City approval of a final map or plat.  The Guarantee of Completion shall be for \n110% of the estimated costs of the public improvements.  The estimated costs shall be determined by \nthe Manager based on the Engineer's estimate, the tabulation of bids or other method acceptable to the \nManager. \nB. \nThe Manager may allow reduction of the guarantee amount as portions of the public improvements are \nsatisfactorily constructed and inspected. 10% percent of the cost of those portions constructed shall be \nretained as the guarantee amount is reduced. Upon acceptance for ownership and operation, the \nguarantee shall be released or returned unless required to satisfy the warranty guarantee requirement in \nSection A5.004. \nC. \nThe Manager shall establish standard forms for the Guarantee of Completion and an administrative \nprocedure for reduction of guarantee amount when permitted. \n \n",

Such separate warranty guarantee shall be for \na period of two years from the date of completion of such repairs.  The Manager shall establish standard \nforms and procedures for the warranty guarantee. \nA5.005  UTILITY EASEMENTS OWNED BY THE PUBLIC \nA. \nPrior to construction of utilities owned by the public outside the public right-of-way or prior to the \napproval of a final plat or final map on a development for which such off-site utilities are required, \napplicant shall provide the City with easement documents for the construction, operation and \nmaintenance of such utilities.

Thereafter, a Notice to Proceed shall not be issued unless the \npublic improvement plan is resubmitted in compliance with the Public Works Standards in effect at the \ntime the plan is resubmitted.

The traffic \ncarrying function is secondary to its transit service function.  Ease of pedestrian movement and \npedestrian safety and transit-supportive development are primary considerations on this type of \nstreet.  This designation is applied in addition to the basic street classification.  \n \nTransit streets are designated on selected streets which currently or are planned to have a high \nfrequency of weekday transit service and some service seven days a week.  The criteria for transit \nstreet designation are: \na. \nCurrent 20 minute (or better) frequency of service, weekday peaks, and; Daytime and \nevening service, weekdays and; Weekend service on both Saturday and Sunday; or \nb. \nA street designated as a regional transit corridor in a regional growth plan or \ntransportation plan, or designated a high capacity or primary transit route in the Gresham \nTransportation System Plan. \nFuture refinement of transit service levels and network may occur through future regional \nand local transportation system planning processes. \n2. \nTransitway \nA transitway serves as an exclusive right-of-way for transit use, either bus or light rail. A transitway \nwill provide regional trunk route service which will be supported by a network of local feeder \nbuses, transit centers, and park-and-ride facilities. \n3. \nTransit Route \nTransit routes are designated on all streets with current but infrequent transit service (that do not \nmeet transit street service criteria).  Transit routes are subject to future designation as transit \nstreets, as future refinement of transit service levels and network occurs through the regional and \nlocal transportation system planning processes. \n4. \nPrivate Access \nA private access serves a number of dwelling units under condominium unit ownership, or within a \nmanufactured home park, or apartments in those areas where a continuation of a public street \nsystem is not needed. \n \nIf the use of private access may create conflicts with efficient local circulation and emergency \naccess needs, public streets may be required. \n5. \nScenic Routes \nA street which offers unique scenic views and is used as a scenic or recreational drive. Access and \ntraffic restrictions may be imposed to preserve the scenic character. This designation may be \napplied in addition to the basic street classification (arterial, collector, or local). \n6. \nAlleys \na. \nAlleys, with a 21-foot-wide right-of-way and 20-foot-wide pavement width, are allowed in \nresidential developments and can provide efficient lot use, support front yard pedestrian \norientation and landscape spaces and reduced lot coverage by driveways.

This standard would be applied when the full standard public street design \nis not necessary due to the limited nature of the access needed to or through park or open space \nareas. The circumstances of the surrounding land use shall be considered when applying this \nspecial function classification. \n \nThe intent of this special function is to minimize the impact and intrusion on the natural systems \nthat exist while providing a minimum level of access for emergency services, maintenance and user \nneeds. \na. \nLimits: The park road standard is principally intended to provide emergency service or park \nuser access to an area that does not possess neighborhood circulation requirements. The \nroad may provide public access to a terminal trailhead, allow ingress and egress for \nmaintenance and operation purposes or to be used for emergency services purposes. \nThe road may be designed with removal traffic control bollards at the entrances to the \nopen space, dependent upon use patterns, to prevent unwanted vehicular traffic. \nb. \nVehicular control devices may be installed to deter vehicular intrusion into the park, open \nspace and natural areas. These include but are not limited to bollards, berms, or 6 inches \nextruded curb, and should be compatible with the surrounding environment and resistant \nto vandalism. \nc. \nParking: Parking shall be permitted only in designed and designated turnouts and parking \nareas. \nd. \nSignage: Signs shall be designed to be compatible with natural character of the site. \nA5.502  INTERSECTIONS   \nConnecting street intersections shall be located to provide for traffic flow, safety, and turning movements, as \nconditions warrant. \nArterial Intersections: Exclusive left and right turn lanes will be provided; bus turnouts will be provided if traffic \nflow and safety conditions warrant; designated crosswalks will be provided at controlled locations; street \nalignments across intersections shall be continuous. \nCollector Street and Local Street Intersections: Street and intersection alignments should facilitate local \ncirculation but avoid alignments that encourage non-local through traffic. \n",
