The purposes of this section include promoting the livability, neighborhood compatibility and \npublic safety of townhouse projects. Site and building design standards are intended to ensure that \nindividual developments contribute to a quality environment for its users and the surrounding \nneighborhood. \nB. Applicability.  The following design standards shall apply to Townhouse projects in the RTC, SC, SC-RJ, \nCMF (except for those along the NE Glisan Ave. and NE 162nd Ave. corridors see Section 7.0431), and \nCMU districts, except as provided in Section 7.0002. In addition, Section 7.0210(B) shall apply to \ntownhouses in Station Center and Rockwood Town Center Districts.  \nC. Street Frontage \n1. Townhouse units are not allowed to be constructed on flag lots except in cases where minimum \ndensity standards would otherwise not be met.   \n2. At least 50% of the site\u2019s frontage (not including access driveways) on any street shall be occupied \nby buildings oriented to the abutting street (excepting courtyard style townhouse projects, also see \nSections 7.0432(D), (G), and (L) below).  Where a site has less than 70 feet of street frontage this \nstandard may be modified to accommodate a driveway meeting code standards. \n3. Courtyard type developments are exempted from maximum setbacks for that portion of a building \nor buildings having a courtyard area between it and the street.  \n4. Projects that include a courtyard fronting a public street shall provide a street fronting building \norientation and doorway access for those portions of the project that directly face and abut a street \nand are not between the street and courtyard. Courtyard development building facades separated \nfrom a street by an approved courtyard are exempt from street orientation requirements. \nD. Building Orientation \n1. Any building abutting a public street right-of-way shall be oriented to the street.  The street \norientation standard is met when the following criteria are satisfied: \na. The primary entry or entries for all ground-floor units abutting the street shall open directly \nonto the street right-of-way, not to the interior of the site or to a parking lot.  Secondary \nentrances may face parking lots or other interior site areas.   \nb. Where a building is on a corner lot and fronts on two abutting streets, a dwelling unit at the \ncorner of the building need be oriented to only one of the streets.  However, if one of the \nabutting streets is a Transit Street, a corner dwelling unit shall be oriented to the Transit Street. \nc. The end unit abutting the street (as applicable) shall have its primary entrance oriented to the \nstreet. \nd. Non-residential buildings, such as recreation or community centers, which abut a public street \nright-of-way shall have at least 20% of the ground floor wall area facing the street in windows, \n",

The \nprimary entry for townhouses with frontage on both a public street and an alley shall be \noriented to the street, not to the alley. \n2. Townhouse units are required to be located adjacent to public streets and alleys and oriented to \npublic streets. Private streets or alleys may be utilized only in districts that permit these following \nadopted public street and public works standards and appropriate design modifications. \n3. The Manager may require that a building that will abut a future street right-of-way, as shown on an \napproved future street plan or neighborhood circulation plan, be oriented to that future right-of-\nway. \n4. In the case of townhouse complexes, private shared accesses to the rear or to common parking \nareas may be provided, subject to City circulation and parking standards.  Such shared access and \nparking areas may be located in easements or tracts and shall not take the place of street \norientation provisions. \nE. Building Separation \n1. Buildings shall face one another with a front-to-front and a back-to-back relationship whether on \neither side of a street, alley, or open space.   \na. An exception to this is with oddly configured properties where a partial building grouping \naccessed (for example) by a short section of public or private street or alley, might be located to \na side in a side-to-rear relationship. \nb. Back to front facing relationships between groups of buildings (such as front doors facing rear \nyards or service areas) are not allowed. \nc. Where property configuration is such that development cannot occur in standard row to row \nrelationships, fronts of units shall not be permitted to face non-street fronting sides or rear of \nthe site.  \nd. Where the rear of a dwelling unit(s) faces the side of another (within the same development \nproject), provide a minimum separation of 20 feet between the building walls of both structures \n(i.e. side to rear). \ne. Where two groups of townhouse buildings in a complex face each other, a minimum separation \nof 30 feet shall be required between front building facades, inclusive of setbacks.  If such a \ngrouping is provided internally within a townhouse complex, the separation area shall include, \nat minimum, a shared pedestrian walkway. \nF. Vehicular Circulation and Parking.  Vehicular circulation and parking shall be provided in accordance \nwith the following standards: \n1. Garage facades shall not be closer to the street than portions of the unit containing living space. \n2. Except for individual driveways which may include parking for townhouses, on-site surface parking \nareas, garages, and vehicular circulation areas shall not be located between a building and an \nabutting street right-of-way. \n3. Public streets shall be dedicated within the site and connected to adjacent streets as required to \ncreate blocks and street intervals that are consistent with Section A5.402(D).  The names of any \nsuch streets dedicated by deed, without a plat, shall be reviewed by and approved by the Manager \nprior to recording.  Where public streets are required, the Manager may require that traffic-calming \nfeatures, such as speed humps, curb extensions, and enhanced pedestrian crosswalks be included in \nthe design and construction of the streets. \n",

Applicable \nstandards of this section regarding site landscaping shall also apply to the development as a whole, \nexcept that any parcel or block within the development shall have a minimum of 20% of its total \narea in landscaping, as defined in Section 3.0103. In all districts, the Manager may require that deed \nrestrictions be recorded to ensure that where project amenities such as swimming pools, \ncommunity centers, and shared open space are on separate parcels within the same development, \nall residents of the development will have on-going access to those amenities and facilities. \n5. Based on the anticipated vehicular and pedestrian traffic generation and the policies of the \nCommunity Development Plan, adequate right-of-way and improvements to abutting streets shall \nbe provided by the applicant and shall meet the street standards of the City.  This may include, but is \nnot limited to, improvements to the right-of-way, such as installation of lighting, signalization, turn \nlanes, paving, curbs, sidewalks, bikeways, dual street name, quadrant, and/or neighborhood \nsignage, and other facilities needed because of anticipated vehicular and pedestrian traffic \ngeneration. \n6. In designing accesses for townhouses, efforts shall be made to mitigate adverse traffic impacts on \nadjacent, low-density residential neighborhoods.  In assessing such impacts, the typical daily street \nvolumes specified in Sections A5.501 shall be considered. \n7. Townhouses shall submit a Neighborhood Parking Analysis that identifies potential on-street parking \nconflicts on adjacent streets and recommends possible mitigation measures. The analysis shall \ninclude an assessment of the supply and demand for adjacent on-street parking and the estimated \non-street parking demand created by the proposed development. Mitigation measures may include, \nbut are not limited to, parking duration limitations, time of day limitations, or supplemental off-\nstreet parking. \nG. Driveways and Unit Access.  The following standards are intended to promote access at the rear of the \nlots so as to limit the number of driveways to the street and to allow for availability of on street parking. \n1. Townhouse lots shall be accessed from the rear by alleyway, rather than from a public street except \nas otherwise authorized within this section.  Exceptions to this are: lots at least 30 feet wide may \ntake direct access a public street or a development of 5 or less lots may access the street directly.  \nPrivate alleys or access drives may be substituted where allowed by the district, where extension \npotential is not feasible and if appropriate maintenance provisions are established.  In addition, a \nprivate side access to a common parking area may also be permitted if parking section standards are \nmet.  (Note:  Townhouse projects on large parcels are not permitted to avoid alleyway and rear \naccess requirements by utilizing multiple structures of 5 or less units/lots or providing serial or by \nsequential land divisions from one \u201cparent\u201d parcel.) \n2. Up to 20% of proposed lots less than 30 feet wide in a townhouse project, and, not covered by \nsubsection (a) above, can be accessed from the front.  \n3. The maximum width for individual single garage driveways located at the front of a dwelling unit is \n10 feet wide (excluding the driveway approach width).  Alternately, a driveway may be wider to \naccess a garage that has a width no larger than 50% of the total dwelling width. \n4. The maximum width for a shared driveway that serves two units or a double car (side-by-side) \ngarage is 20 feet (excluding the driveway approach width) where the maximum driveway width is 16 \nfeet. \n5. A minimum distance of 20 feet shall be between driveways, whether shared or individual, so as to \nallow for on street parking. \n",
