Section 7.0503 also does not apply to public \nfacilities (as described in Appendix 5: Public Facilities). \nDuplexes, Triplexes, and Quadplexes in the Rockwood Design District shall follow \nthe Section 7.0100 Corridor Design District Design Guidelines and Standards.\nHeadings in this section apply to (except as exempted above):\nAll Development: All developments except townhouses and the industrial uses \npermitted in the Station Center-Ruby Junction land use district.\nCommercial and Institutional: All developments that are commercial or \ninstitutional uses, including commercial or institutional uses as components \nof mixed-use structures. However, Parks, Open Spaces and Trails are not \nincluded. \nResidential Development:\nMultifamily Residential: Multifamily, Elderly Housing, and Residential \nFacilities, unless otherwise specified.\nTownhouse: Townhouses.\nExisting Development: Guidelines and standards in Section 7.0503(A) shall apply \nas determined by the Manager or Design Commission when the standards \ncan reasonably apply to existing development. For example, landscaping \nguidelines and standards may apply when new landscaping is being added. \nGuidelines and standards in Section 7.0503(B) apply to buildings that were \nconstructed prior to Dec. 1, 2011, as indicated by the standards under the \n\u201cExisting Development\u201d heading in those sections.

It is also recognized that Gresham is \ncomprised of many districts and neighborhoods \u2013 each one unique with \ndistinct physical, social, and economic conditions and special assets to build \nupon to attract quality investment. Therefore, certain districts have their own \ndesign standards and guidelines to address design concerns that have cultural, \narchitectural, or even market significance to that area. \nAs part of the 2011 Council Work Plan, the Rockwood Design Standards and \nGuidelines augment existing Code regulations which apply to the area. These \nDesign Guidelines and Standards provide Rockwood with the regulations that \nidentify good site and building design thereby facilitating the development of \nhigh-quality, attractive, innovative, sustainable and livable developments that \nfoster a true sense of community. \nC. Design Review Process: \nNew Rockwood developments, additions and remodels are subject to design \nreview as defined in Section 7.0500 for the determination of consistency with \nthe Criteria, Guidelines and/or Standards contained in this Code. Projects subject \nto design review are either reviewed by the Design Commission or reviewed by \nthe Manager. Either the Design Commission or the Manager shall make findings \nand decisions concerning conformance with the Design Standards or Guidelines \nbased on which review process is selected. Refer to Article 11 Procedures for \nreview process details.\nD. How to Use this Code: \n1. Design Review: Two Track Process\nThe City has set up two tracks for the Design Review process. Applicants have \nthe choice of complying with either op\u019f on:\na. Discretionary Process. The discretionary process is intended to permit in-\nnovative and creative development proposals that might not comply with \nall or some of the Standards in Section 7.0500 to be reviewed and permit-\nted if the projects meet the Design Guidelines, Intent Statement and Prin-\nciples. The aim is to encourage applicants to propose exciting, innovative \ndesigns while still ensuring the City\u2019s design goals and objectives are met. \nThe Design Commission may waive a Guideline or Guidelines to achieve \nthe flexibility necessary to support a particularly creative proposal. Ap-\nproval requires that the applicant demonstrate to the Design Commission \nthat the waiver from the Guideline(s) would result in a development that \nbetter meets the applicable Design Principles and the Intent Statement \npreceding the Guidelines. \nb. Clear and Objective Process. The Clear and Objective Process includes \nmeasurable Standards to meet the desired urban form. In the Clear and \nObjective Process the applicant must meet all relevant Design Standards. \nDeviation from any of the Standards or referenced Standards in Article 7 \nwill place the application in the Discretionary Process.\n",

Rockwood Design Guidelines and Standards Layout: \nThe Rockwood design regula\u019f ons apply to two primary areas, the Rockwood \nTriangle Area and the Outside Triangle Area, to recognize the unique charac-\nteris\u019f cs of the two areas. See Figure 7.0501(B). \nRockwood Triangle Area. The Rockwood Triangle Area is defined as the \nTriangle Area bounded by Stark Street on the south, Burnside on the \nnorth, 181st on the west and 190th on the east. This area is located in the \ncenter of Rockwood and is to be the cultural and social hub of Rockwood. \nThe Triangle Area is a true community of residences and smaller scale \nservices in a walkable, pedestrian-oriented environment with integrated \nopen spaces.\nOutside Triangle Area. The Outside Triangle Area includes all areas outside \nthe Rockwood Triangle Area but still within the Rockwood Design District. \nWithin each of those two areas there are two categories of Guidelines and \nStandards:\na. Site Design: Site Design Guidelines and Standards address the organiza-\n\u019f on and arrangement of a development\u2019s components. They focus on the \nloca\u019f on and orienta\u019f on of buildings, parking, service areas, landscaping \nand site features such as open space. Good site planning is of cri\u019f cal im-\nportance to the design of commercial, mixed-use, civic, industrial and res-\niden\u019f al development. Excellent site design can improve the aesthe\u019f cs of \na community, minimize a project\u2019s impacts on its neighbors, improve the \nquality of the streetscape, relate to or establish desirable development \npa\u01a9 erns, promote sustainability and improve neighborhood connec\u019f vity. \nb. Building Design: Building Design Guidelines and Standards address the \nmassing and exterior architectural elements of buildings \u2013 components \nthat de\ufb01 ne the scale, quality and character of a building, such as roofs, \nentries, windows, materials and details. Excellent building designs en-\nhance the quality of life for residents and promote sustainability by \nimproving the appearance of the city, by promo\u019f ng the conserva\u019f on of \nnatural resources, by establishing a sense of community, and by improv-\ning the long-term economic value of the proper\u019f es.\nFigure 7.0501(B)\n",

Physical Environment: Create a physical environment that fosters a positive image of \nRockwood and embraces its unique character thereby allowing businesses to thrive and \nprosper.\nB. Sustainability: Implement measures that promote the efficient use of land and resources \nby conserving and protecting trees, water and topography; reducing pesticide use; \nmaximizing surface water infiltration; promoting energy conservation; promoting \nresident health; and other sustainability measures.\nC. Safe Design: Design buildings, streets and public places that are safe and inviting for \nresidents and visitors.\nD. Transportation Modes: Encourage multimodal design to support transportation choices \nand access opportunities.\nE. Open Space: Develop open spaces where they are needed most and improve access to \nexisting and future parks and public spaces.\nF. Landscaping: Incorporate landscape elements such as trees, shrubs, and groundcover \ninto a sustainable landscaping plan that provides an attractive green setting for \nRockwood while reinforcing the architecture and softening the building scale. \nG. Compatibility: Respect stable neighborhoods.\nBuilding Design Principles\nH. Architectural Quality: Create aesthetically pleasing, durable architecture for \ndevelopments that contributes to the sense of place.\nI. \nSustainable Architectural Design: Promote sustainable architectural design that \npromotes energy efficiency, conservation of resources and other sustainability measures.\nJ. \nRehabilitation: Accommodate rehabilitation of existing structures and sites where the \nstructures and sites will contribute in a positive manner to the desired urban form of \nRockwood.\nK. Housing Variety: Improve the variety of housing types for current and future Rockwood \nresidents.\nL. High-Quality Materials: Utilize building materials that are of the highest quality and \npermanence, and that build a sense of place for Rockwood.\n",
