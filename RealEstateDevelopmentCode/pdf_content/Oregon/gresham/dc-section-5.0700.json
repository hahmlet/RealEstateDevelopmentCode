Where the NRO imposes restrictions that are more stringent than other \napplicable state, regional and federal requirements, the provisions of the NRO shall govern. \nB. \nExcept as provided below, where the provisions of this overlay conflict with comparable provisions of \nthe Gresham Community Development Code,  the more restrictive shall govern, provided that within the \nboundaries of a Resource Area, the tree removal and mitigation requirements of this overlay shall \nsupersede those of Section 9.1000.   \nC. \nProposed development located near streams with regulated floodplains or identified flood prone areas \nshall also comply with the Floodplain Overlay District standards of Section 5.0100 of the Community \nDevelopment Code. Areas affected by this District are shown on the City\u2019s Special Purpose Districts \nMap. \nD. \nProposed development located on or near sites with steeper slopes may also be affected by the Hillside \nand Geologic Risk Overlay (HGRO) provisions of Section 5.0200 of the Community Development \nCode. This Overlay may impose additional development requirements for sites with ravines and other \nsloped topographic features. Areas affected by this Overlay are shown on the City\u2019s Special Purpose \nDistricts Map. \nE. \nDevelopment in or near wetlands and streams may require permits from the Oregon Department of State \nLands (DSL) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If a federal permit is required, a water quality \ncertification from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality may also be required. The City \nManager shall notify the Department of State Lands and the Army Corps of Engineers when an \napplication for development within streams and wetlands is submitted. Because these agencies may \nhave more restrictive regulations than the City, Applicants are encouraged to contact them before they \nprepare their development plans. \nF. \nEnvironmental Technical Guidance Manual.

Construction or expansions of right-of-way improvements. \ng. Placement or stockpiling of wood debris. \n2. Mapped Resource Area (RA), High Value Resource Area (HVRA), and Potential Resource Area \n(PRA) boundaries are based on a GIS-supported application of the mapping protocols in Section \n5.0714.  The boundaries may be verified or amended in accordance with Section 5.0715.  In \ngeneral, these areas include the following: \na. Resource Areas (RA) include regulated wetlands and their buffers, regulated streams and their \nbuffers, other regulated waters including lakes and ponds and their buffers, and designated \nupland habitat. Within the RA are subareas of particularly high value.  These subareas are \ndesignated as High Value Resource Areas (HVRA).  All references in this chapter to Resource \nAreas shall be understood to include High Value Resource Areas. \nb. Potential Resource Areas (PRA) include areas that were identified as \u201cpotential wetlands\u201d in a \nLocal Wetland Inventory Survey and areas that have been identified as having a high \nprobability of potential regulated wetlands, but have not been reviewed as part of a Local \nWetland Inventory Survey. \n3. Development within an RA in accordance with the provisions of the NRO shall not result in a \nchange of the RA status of such developed areas on a property. \n4. Properties containing Potential Resource Areas are subject to Section 5.0703(B). If no Resource \nAreas are identified in the PRA review, then the requirements of NRO do not apply. \n5. All development permit applications within the NRO which propose non-exempt activities within \n50 feet of, but not within, a Resource Area, shall comply with Section 5.0706(A).   \n6. Jurisdictional wetlands and waters are those subject to local, state, and/or federal authority.  A \njurisdictional wetland or stream identified during the course of a development permit review that \nmeets the mapping protocols in Section 5.0714 shall be subject to the NRO standards. Such \nwetlands or streams shall be added to the NRO map by the Manager, after DSL and City \nconcurrence. If a wetland or stream is identified that does not meet Title 3 criteria, it is not subject \nto the standards of this section but may still require a federal or state permit. \nB. \nPotential Resource Area (PRA) Determination \nThese regulations are required to protect water quality resources pursuant to Goal 6 and Metro \nFunctional Plan Title 3 \n1. Review. All applications for non-exempt uses and activities within areas designated as Potential \nResource Areas on the map are subject to a review to determine whether Resource Areas \n(specifically wetlands) are present.   \na. The review shall cover all proposed disturbance area(s) and all on-site land within 100 feet of \nthe disturbance area(s). \nb. The review may be processed separately as a Type I review or concurrently with another \ndevelopment permit. \nc. All wetland determinations must be conducted in accordance with the 1987 U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers Wetlands Delineation Manual, including regional supplements and applicable \nguidance and any supporting technical guidance documents, rules, and regulations issued by the \nState of Oregon and the Oregon Department of State Lands. \n",

Minimize impacts. If the Applicant demonstrates that there is no practicable alternative that will \navoid disturbance of the RA or HVRA, then the development proposed by the Applicant within the \nRA or HVRA shall minimize unavoidable impacts to the extent practicable. If there is HVRA on a \nproperty, then the development within HVRA shall be considered more detrimental than \ndevelopment within other parts of the RA. \na. The applicant\u2019s Alternatives Analysis and Impact Evaluation must demonstrate that the \nproposed development will minimize unavoidable impacts to ecological functions and loss of \nhabitat consistent with uses allowed by right under the base zone, to the extent practicable. \nb. To the extent practicable within the RA, the proposed development shall be designed, located, \nand constructed to minimize grading, removal of native vegetation, disturbance and removal of \nnative soils, adverse hydrological impacts on water resources , and impacts on wildlife corridors \nand fish passage through the use of the best management practices and habitat-friendly \ndevelopment practices.  Examples of these are outlined in the City of Gresham Environmental \nTechnical Guidance Manual. \n3. Mitigate impacts. If the Applicant demonstrates that there is no practicable alternative that will \navoid disturbance of the RA, then development shall mitigate for unavoidable impacts. The \nmitigation plan must demonstrate how the functions listed in 5.0713A(1)a are maintained or \nenhanced.  All proposed mitigation plans shall meet the following standards: \na.

Regulated streams are designated as HVRAs. Regulated streams include all \nstreams shown on the City\u2019s GIS stream layer. The GIS stream layer was developed by \nmodeling LiDAR topography and ground-truthing streams identified in headwater situations.  \nStreams are continued through other waters and wetlands where applicable. \nb. Buffer. The RA and HVRA associated with a regulated stream include a buffer on either side \nmeasured from the centerline of the stream. The width of the RA and HVRA varies depending \non stream order as described in Table 5.0714-1.
