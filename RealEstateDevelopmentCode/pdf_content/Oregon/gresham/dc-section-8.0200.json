Nonconforming situations can be made up of either a \nnonconforming use or a nonconforming development, which are defined in Section 3.0100, Definitions. \n8.0211  Legal Nonconforming Situations  \nLegal non-conforming (\u201cGrandfather\u201d) situations recognize that all uses and developments are not required to \nconform automatically to changes in the Community Development Code.  The following subsections may be \nconsidered a legal non-conforming situation: \nA. \nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, any situation lawfully existing prior to the implementation \nof this development code on August 27, 1992  or subsequent amendments to the development code shall \nbe defined as a legal nonconforming situation and may be continued so long as it remains otherwise \nlawful. \nB. \nA lot of record or a parcel of land for which a deed or other instrument dividing the land was recorded \nwith Multnomah County prior to December 16, 1975, or either approved by Multnomah County or \nrecorded prior to July 26, 1979, if annexed after that date, may be occupied by uses as provided in \nArticle 4 - Land Use Districts of this ordinance. \nC. \nA pre-existing address that is determined not to conform to current City standards as specified in the \nDevelopment Code and City of Gresham Street Naming and Property Addressing Guidelines is not \nconsidered a legal non-conforming situation and is not allowed to remain, once identified.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the \nstrengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by \nany official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. \nE. \nThe alteration, enlargement, or moving of a nonconforming use or development shall not increase \ndetrimental effects (i.e. noise, vehicle traffic, vibration, dust, odor, fumes, smoke, or glare) in the \nsurrounding area greater than the effects from the existing use or development generated at the time it \nbecame nonconforming.

An \nexample would be the replacement of an automotive tire and brake repair facility by an automotive \nmuffler shop.  Any such replacement is subject to compliance with Sections 8.0220 and 8.0231. \nK. \nAn alteration to a nonconforming development that requires a design review as per Section 7.0000 shall \nbe subject to all current standards with the exception that existing nonconforming structures are allowed \nto remain in a nonconforming condition.  Enlargement of a nonconforming structure is subject to this \nsection and Section 8.0221, and to applicable design review standards.  New development and \nstructures on a nonconforming development site are subject to all current standards. \nL. \nThe conversion of a legally established nonconforming hotel or motel to an emergency shelter or to \naffordable housing is permitted.
