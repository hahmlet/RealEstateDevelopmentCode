This provision shall not apply to Type IV legislative \napplications that require city-wide mailed notice.  \n11.0203  Classification of Applications by Procedure \nA. \nProcedure Types.  An application shall be subject to the procedure type specified in the code.  Table \n11.0204 identifies the procedure type for the majority of the land use applications described in this code. \nIf the code does not specify a procedure type for a given application and another procedure is not \nrequired by law, the Manager shall determine the appropriate procedure based on the following \nguidelines: \n1. \nType I procedures apply to ministerial permits and applications based on clear and objective \napproval criteria or criteria that require the exercise of professional judgment only about \n",

The Type IV procedure generally applies to a relatively large \ngeographic area containing many property owners.  \nB. \nDetermination of Proper Procedure Type and Concurrent Reviews \n1. \nThe Manager shall determine whether a permit or application is categorized as Type I, II, III or \nIV in accordance with the guidelines set forth above.  Questions as to the appropriate procedure \nshall be resolved in favor of the procedure type providing the greatest notice and opportunity to \nparticipate.   \n2. \nAn application that involves two or more procedures may be processed collectively under the \nhighest numbered procedure required for any part of the application or processed individually or \nconcurrently under the procedures identified by the code, with the reviews ordered from highest \nlevel of review to lowest level of review. When a new or revised Future Street Plan is done \nconcurrently with a Design Review Type E, it must be done as a Type II with a Manager\u2019s \ndecision. \n3. \nThe applicant may determine whether the application will be processed collectively or \nindividually, with the exception of a new or revised Future Street Plan, done concurrently with a \nDesign Review Type E, which shall be done as a Type II.  \n4. \nIn the event that the completed applications that are processed collectively involve applications \nwhere the decision making authority is a combination of the Manager, the Hearings Officer, \nDesign Commission or Planning Commission, the decision making authority will be the highest \ndecision authority assigned by Table 11.0204.  \n5. \nNotwithstanding any other provision, and, upon payment of the proper fee, an applicant may \nchoose to have the proposal processed under a procedure type (except Type IV) which provides \ngreater notice and opportunity to participate than would otherwise be required and with the \nexception of a new or revised Future Street Plan, done concurrently with a Design Review Type \nE, which must be done as a Type II.   \nC. \nMiddle Housing Land Division. A Middle Housing Land Division (Section 6.0500) is not a land use \ndecision or a limited land use decision (ORS 197.015). \nD. \nA conversion of a hotel or motel to an emergency shelter or to affordable housing under Section \n10.0420 is not land use decision or a limited land use decision (ORS 197.015).  \nE. \nAn application for an affordable housing development under Section 10.1700 is not a unique \napplication type. An affordable housing development application, including an application for a \nresidential use in a land use district exclusively permitted under Section 10.1700 shall be subject to the \nprocedure type specified in Table 11.0204. \n11.0204  Review Authorities \nA. \nPurpose.  Review authorities are established to make recommendations and decisions on land use \napplications and to recommend land use policy to the City Council.  The review authorities provide an \n",
