As used in this section, a \u201cmiddle housing land \ndivision\u201d is the division of a lot or parcel on which the development of middle housing is allowed under ORS \n197.758 (2) or (3). A Middle Housing Land Division includes both a preliminary approval and a final plat and is \nnot a land use decision or a limited land use decision under ORS 197.015. \n6.0502 APPLICABILITY  \nA. Lots in the following districts or portions of districts may be divided for middle housing development \nfollowing the Middle Housing Land Division process outlined in this section:  LDR-7, LDR-5, TR, TLDR, MDR-\n12 (lots of record only), OFR (lots of record only), LDR-GB, LDR-PV, MDR-PV, VLDR-SW, LDR-SW, DRL-1, \nDRL-2, and those portions of CMF along the NE Glisan and NE 162nd Avenue corridors.  \nB. This section applies only to Middle Housing Land Divisions permitted on or after July 1, 2022.  \nC. The Section 6.0500 Middle Housing Land Divisions process applies unless the applicant requests to use the \nprocedures in Section 6.0200. \n6.0503 REVIEW CRITERIA AND STANDARDS \nA. The Manager shall approve a Middle Housing Land Division upon finding: \n1. The parent lot or parcel is developed with Middle Housing, or the application for middle housing land \ndivision is concurrent with a building permit for construction of middle housing on the subject parcel. \nWhere the parent lot or parcel has an existing dwelling unit(s) not classified as middle housing, the \ndwelling(s) shall be converted to middle housing through the concurrent building permit. \n2. Each resulting middle housing lot shall contain exactly one dwelling unit, except for lots, parcels, or \ntracts used as common areas.  \n3. Each lot is served with utilities separately. \n4. All easements necessary for each dwelling unit shall be provided.  Easements shall ensure:  \na. Provision of and access for maintenance and replacement to all utilities; \nb. Pedestrian access from each dwelling unit to a private or public road; \nc.

Where the parent lot or parcel abuts the street and dedication or frontage improvements consistent with \nTable A5.501 were not provided when the lot or parcel was created, dedication and improvements shall \nbe provided that meet the standards of A5.500 and the Public Works Standards. \nE.

The Manager shall not enforce any provision in a recorded instrument affecting real property that is \nexecuted on or after August 8, 2019 if the provision would allow the development of a single detached \ndwelling on the real property but would prohibit the development of, or the partitioning or subdividing \nof lands according to the provisions of Section 6.0500 for, the following: \na. Middle housing, as defined in ORS 197.758 (Development of Middle Housing; Local Regulations); \nor \nb. An accessory dwelling unit allowed under ORS 197.312(5) (Limitation on City and County \nProhibitions \u2013 Needed Housing within UGBs). \nF. The Manager shall not require the final plat before it issues building permits, but is not responsible if \nutilities or buildings must be moved to meet code requirements relating to property line location. \nG. Planned Developments and Planned Communities. For development created through Section 6.0300 or \nORS 94.550-94.783 the following shall apply: \n1. Lots or parcels resulting from the division of land in a planned community are subject to the governing \ndocuments of the planned community and are allocated assessments and voting right on the same \nbasis as existing units.  \n2. Judicial partition by division of a lot in a planned community is not allowed unless: \na. The declaration expressly allows the division of lots in a planned community; or \nb. The lot may be divided under ORS 94.776 (Restrictions on Allowable Maximum Density \nProhibited). \n3. The lot may be partitioned by sale and divisions of the proceeds under ORS 105.245 (Sale or Partition \nOrdered by Court).  \n4. The restrictions noted in subsection (2) above do not apply if the homeowners association has \nremoved the property from the provisions of the declaration.  \n \n \n",
