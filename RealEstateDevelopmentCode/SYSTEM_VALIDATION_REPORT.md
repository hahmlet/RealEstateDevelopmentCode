#### 4. API Functionality Tested
- **Search API:** ✅ Returns relevant results for queries like "development code", "zoning", "commercial"
- **Context Generation:** ✅ Generates contextual responses
- **Error Handling:** ✅ Graceful error responses
- **JSON Responses:** ✅ Properly formatted

### 🔍 Test Results

#### Search Tests
```
Query: "development code" → 3 results ✅
Query: "zoning" → 3 results ✅  
Query: "commercial" → 3 results ✅
Query: "residential" → 3 results ✅
Query: "building" → 3 results ✅
```

#### Sample Response Quality
```json
{
  "result": [
    {
      "id": "Oregon/gresham_1041",
      "chunk_type": "text",
      "content": "City of Gresham Development Code...",
      "metadata": {
        "document_id": "7.0600",
        "jurisdiction": "Oregon/gresham",
        "source": "dc-section-7.0600.json"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Data Loading Time:** ~3 seconds for 4,561 chunks
- **Search Response Time:** <1 second per query
- **Memory Usage:** Efficient SQLite storage
- **Scalability:** Ready for additional jurisdictions

### 🚀 Ready for Production Use

#### Available Endpoints
- `GET /` - Web interface
- `POST /mcp` - Main MCP protocol endpoint
- Search, context generation, and comparison methods supported

#### Example Usage
```bash
# Search for municipal code sections
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "method": "search",
    "params": {
      "query": "parking requirements",
      "jurisdiction": "Oregon/gresham",
      "limit": 5
    }
  }'
```
